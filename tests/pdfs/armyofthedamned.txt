This is a fan-made adventure module using the D&D 5e 
system. All resources for running this adventure can be 
found here. All illustrations and names used from Magic:

Innistrad is a setting steeped in gothic horror themes 
and makes liberal use of horror tropes. Werewolves hunt 
within the forests, vengeful spirits haunt the places of 
their grisly deaths, hedonistic vampires feast on humans 
at their leisure, and Frankenstein-like mad scientists 
create abominations stitched together from corpses. All 
these classic horror stories are merged together to create 
a unified campaign setting that is much more than the 
sum of its parts, an amazing and compelling backdrop for 
epic storytelling.
Learning About Innistrad
The vast majority of Innistrad’s backstory can be found 
in the A Planeswalker’s Guide to Innistrad  series on 
Wizards’ official site. The entire series does a great job 
summarizing everything you, the DM, need to know about 
the setting. Read it over once and then have it open for 
reference when running a game and you’ll be set.The first part of the series, Introduction , can work as a 
handout to give to players whose characters are native 
to Innistrad, as it contains mostly general knowledge – 
though you may omit bits of information at your discretion.
Players may have access to additional information based 
on which of the four provinces their characters hail from 
(if any). If a character lives in Kessig, you may want to 
give that player access to some of the information in A 
Planeswalker’s Guide to Innistrad: Kessig  as well, but 
double check to see if there’s any information you as the 
DM would rather withhold. You’ll likely want to omit the 
section about werewolves, as such information probably 
isn’t known by average folk, and even some parts may be 
a mystery to werewolves themselves.
Characters that aren’t locals may also discover 
information about places and people with appropriate 
Intelligence checks, such as Intelligence (Religion) to recall 
lore about the Church of Avacyn, or Intelligence (Nature) 
to recall lore about the basic geography of Stensia.

Introduction
2Adapting Innistrad to D&D
Innistrad is very compatible as a D&D setting. Almost 
everything in the setting functions well under the D&D 
system.  
Classes
The classes present in the Player’s Handbook  not only 
fit seamlessly into the setting, nearly all of them are 
explicitly mentioned in the official lore:
• Paladins and Clerics would be exemplary soldiers and 
leaders within the Church of Avacyn, blessed with the 
capability to wield the Light and spread the Church’s 
influence to the most dangerous corners of the world. 
They would most likely start their careers in Thraben, 
the seat of the Church.
• Rangers and Druids are both tied to the forests that 
cover most of Innistrad. Rangers are often hunters 
and wilderness guides, while Druids act as curators 
of the forests and mediators of ancient forest spirits. 
Both tap into the ancient, primal powers of nature 
that have been forgotten by most folk since the rise of 
the Avacyn Church.
• Bards and Rogues are drawn to more densely 
populated cities, such as the ones found in the province Nephalia, to earn coin from their respective 
trades. Bards travel from town to town as entertainers 
while Rogues often use their talents in criminal 
activities.
• Wizards pursue academic interests and are often well-
respected scholars, astronomers, and alchemists. In 
the pursuit of knowledge, some require isolation in 
a quiet village or off somewhere on their own, while 
others seek colleagues in Nephalia’s larger towns to 
combine research
• Barbarians often come from the province Kessig, a 
reflection of the untamed spirit of the land and its 
people. Some scholars point out similarities between 
a barbarian’s rage and the ferocity of werewolves.
• Fighters come from all walks of life. These disciplined 
martial masters are often hired muscle for a wide 
variety of tasks, or do the work of the Avacyn Church 
as cathars, the militia of the Church.
• Sorcerers seem to manifest their powers out of 
nowhere, though there are rumors of the magic 
coming from their blood, or being permanently 
changed after exposure to raw magic.
• Warlocks can be anyone willing to make the taboo pact 
for power: Skirsdag cultists gladly enter them with the 
fiends they worship, those in touch with nature make 
pacts with the powerful fey spirits living in the forests, 
and most rare are the mad few that acquire a dark 
patron from beyond Innistrad itself. Warlocks must 
keep their pacts a secret or else face persecution, 
especially from the Church of Avacyn.
• Monks are a little tougher to fit, but it wouldn’t be a 
huge stretch to say that perhaps most are trained as 
cathars for the Avacyn Church or are brought up in 
remote villages.
Races
One issue that you must decide upon is what races to 
allow from the Player’s Handbook  as natives of Innistrad. 
The official lore seems to indicate that elves have gone 
extinct long ago, and that other fantasy staple races like 
dwarves and halflings do not exist in this world. 
There are a few ways to interpret the absence of non-
human races. The most straightforward option would be 
to only allow human characters as natives of Innistrad. If 
you choose this option, it’s strongly recommended that 
you let the players use the Player’s Guide to Innistrad: 
Human Variants  by redditor /u/Nihilates; the guide 
allows for mechanical variety within the human race and 
serves as a wonderful primer for players to learn about the 
province that their character hails from.
 Another option would be to treat non-human natives 
as exceptionally rare: elves live in small communities deep

within forests, using cunning magics to keep themselves 
isolated from the outside world. Tieflings could be the 
result of sadistic experiments carried out by the demon-
worshipping Skirsdag cultists – in fact, there is at least 
one official human/devil hybrid in the lore already: the 
planeswalker Tibalt. With a little bit of creativity you can 
fit any PHB race into Innistrad, but any non-human would 
certainly be a shock to the human locals they come across.
Religions
Another possible issue is what religions to allow. The 
majority of Innistrad’s citizens worship the angel Avacyn, 
while minor sects pray to demons, and others give 
homage to woodland spirits. Do the natives of Innistrad 
have knowledge of other gods such as Bahamut and 
Pelor? Again, it’s up to you, the DM, to figure out what to 
allow in your version of Innistrad. Just remember there’s 
always a solution. 
Innistrad in the D&D 
Universe
In the universe of Magic: The Gathering, Innistrad is its 
own separate plane, and the only known outsiders are 
planeswalkers. If you wish to bring Innistrad into the D&D universe, just plop it into the Material Plane as its own 
world, like Forgotten Realms  and Greyhawk  are. Visitation 
from outsiders would still be rare (much like the odd 
planeswalker visit) but it would allow outsider PCs with 
different races/religions to enter the land with the help of 
a portal or some advanced magic. 
If we go a little further with this idea, the gothic horror 
doom and gloom that pervades all of Innistrad could be 
the influence of the Shadowfell; perhaps that shadowy 
plane has an unusually strong presence/overlap on this 
world. That’s why the sun shines dimmer, the spirits of 
the dead are more restless, and everything is all-around 
dark and sinister compared to other worlds in the Material 
Plane.
The Truth About The Moon
Let’s take things one step further. What if this strong tie to 
the Shadowfell came from a specific source? A source that 
is tied to many of Innistrad’s supernatural happenings, 
dampening protective wards and empowering both 
werewolves and vampires? Yes, Innistrad’s link to the 
Shadowfell is the moon.
The Innistrad moon is a massive portal to the Shadowfell 
plane. No one remembers what sinister entity constructed 
this link between planes, but the world of Innistrad was 
set to be consumed utterly by the Shadowfell. The deity 
Art by Ryan Yee

Introduction
4that saved Innistrad from being swallowed up by the 
Shadowfell has similarly been lost to history. 
This god could not close the immense portal, but 
managed to block off and imprison the portal at the cost 
of the deity’s life. The god’s corpse engulfs the portal as 
a massive desert of silver. The barrier of silver stops the 
Shadowfell from consuming the world, but does not block 
its influence entirely. You can see an imprint of the long-
forgotten god on the moon to this day – it’s the heron on 
the moon’s surface.
This explains the seemingly paradoxical nature of 
Innistrad’s moon: the portal to the Shadowfell inside of 
the moon empowers evil creatures, while the outside 
surface of silver empowers good. A full moon is when the 
portal to the Shadowfell is largest and is consequently 
when werewolves are strongest, yet blessed silver from 
the moon is the most effective at defeating them.
Running The Adventure
Army of the Damned  is an adventure for four characters 
of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the 
characters will advance to 5th level. You can keep track 
of experience by writing down the experience gained per 
event, which is provided by the module. Alternatively, you 
can choose the milestone experience system and level up 
when the adventure calls for it.
To properly run this adventure, you will need Monster 
Manual  for D&D 5e. The combat statistics of monsters 
and NPCs in this adventure will be cited to the appropriate 
page. For example, Jeleva is a vampire spellcaster (MM 
p298), which means you will find her combat statistics in 
Monster Manual page 298. New monsters will have their 
statistics provided in APPENDIX B.
Similarly, magic items found over the course of this 
adventure will have their page in the Dungeon Master’s 
Guide  cited. New items will have their statistics provided 
in APPENDIX A.
The aforementioned Planeswalker’s Guide to Innistrad  
should be read to get a feel for the adventure’s setting. 
All other information will be provided here in the module.
Adjusting Difficulty
The combat events are tuned for four characters of the 
appropriate level (starting at level 1), following the combat 
difficulty guide outlined in Dungeon Master’s Guide . 
If for any reason you wish to strengthen/weaken the 
combat encounters, it’s highly recommended that you 
use an encounter builder such as Kobold Fight Club . 
These builders use the calculations outlined in Dungeon 
Master’s Guide  and will help you adjust the difficulty 
of combat by adding/removing monsters to reach the desired difficulty.
For example, 3 zombies (MM p316) are a Hard challenge 
for four level 1 PCs. If you have five level 1 PCs instead, that 
same encounter becomes a Medium challenge. You can 
bump the difficulty back to Hard by adding an additional 
zombie to the encounter.
With your handy online encounter builder, tuning 
combat difficulty to your personal playgroup is a quick 
and painless process.
Adventure Background
Humanity’s Peril
The archangel Avacyn, the central figure of the Church 
of Avacyn and the main conduit of holy magic on the 
plane, hasn’t been seen over the last few seasons, and her 
absence shows. Since Avacyn has disappeared, prayers 
have not spared remote villages from werewolf attacks as 
they once did. Holy symbols have not stopped vampires 
from preying on travelers in the high mountain passes. 
The dead are not protected from tampering by ghoulcallers 
and flesh-animating alchemists called skaberen. With the 
power of holy magic waning, humanity is being pushed 
into a corner by an encroaching darkness that threatens 
to consume them.
Only a select few elders in the Church, including 
Mikaeus, the ruling Lunarch, know what has happened 
to Avacyn; the archangel is trapped within the Helvault 
after a desperate struggle with the demon Griselbrand. To 
save Avacyn (if she is even alive) would require shattering 
the Helvault and releasing hundreds of years’ worth of 
captured demons imprisoned within the silver prison with 
her, a risky move that may doom the plane utterly.
One Hope
Mikaeus and a handful of his most trusted advisors 
hatched a desperate plan: they believe that an artifact in the 
Church’s possession, a mystical tuning fork, holds the key 
to retrieving Avacyn from the Helvault without releasing 
the demons trapped with her. Not understanding how 
to wield the artifact themselves, the elders have secretly 
delivered the fork to a musical prodigy in Stensia named 
Katarina Brunn, hoping her talents can unlock its power 
while the Church tries to maintain order in the world. 
Mikaeus knows that the secret demon-worshiping cult, 
the Skirsdag, have human members embedded within 
Thraben in all levels of the church, nobility, and the trades; 
the Lunarch believed it would be safer if Katarina studied 
the artifact in her home town of Shadowgrange, far away 
from the Skirsdag’s influence. The province of Stensia has

plenty of its own dangers, however.
Voldaren’s Lesson
Katarina Brunn led the local militia of Shadowgrange, 
having trained as a paladin in her youth, even joining the 
ranks of the Riders of Gavony for a time. As impressive 
as her martial and leadership abilities were, it was her 
reputation of being a musical prodigy that made the 
Acacynian Church elders decide to select her to unlock 
the mysteries of the tuning fork artifact. Indeed, she was 
making great progress into figuring out the artifact.
Shadowgrange is one of the bleakest places in all 
of Innistrad. Aside from their own local members, the 
people are isolated from the Church of Avacyn’s influence. 
Shadowgrange is situated deep in the heart of Stensia, 
surrounded by vampire estates that view humans as 
cattle, and is mostly cut off from the outside world. The 
villagers are fiercely passionate about their lifestyles and 
have immense pride in their traditions. This is mostly a 
coping mechanism to hide the truth – they are paranoid 
and fearful of their situation. Villagers disappear with a 
grim regularity, usually as a meal for vampires, and the people have been conditioned for generations to do 
nothing about it.
There were murmurs of change in the past few years, 
however. Katarina and her fiancee, an alchemist named 
Siegfried, led a movement to defend themselves from the 
vampires and other horrors in the night. They bolstered 
the town’s defenses and tried to convince the villagers 
to fight. For a while, their efforts were successful – until 
Avacyn disappeared, and the holy wards around the village 
began to falter.
Two months ago, while Katarina was deep in her 
experiments with the artifact, vampires from Voldaren 
Manor entered the village. The vampires were preparing to 
celebrate the disturbing three-day holiday called Court of 
the Vampire Queen, and came to collect their unfortunate 
“Queen” – Katarina, the troublemaker. Katarina, Ralph, 
and Siegfried fought the vampires alone. The trio pleaded 
and begged with the villagers to help, but their friends and 
neighbors all stood by, frozen in fear. In the end, Ralph was 
killed, Katarina was taken, and Siegfried was convinced by 
his love to flee and keep the artifact safe.

Introduction
6Revenge of the Damned
Siegfried was devastated with what happened. He and 
Katarina’s family dedicated their lives to serve and protect 
the people of Shadowgrange, only to be betrayed by them. 
In a fit of rage, grief, and despair, he left the village, vowing 
vengeance on all of Katarina’s murderers. 
The alchemist has taken up residence in the abandoned 
Maurer Estate. There he pursues the darker side of 
alchemy, the necro-alchemy of producing skaabs. 
Siegfried has teamed up with ghoulcaller Rinelda Smit, 
and together they have a mad plan to build an army of 
skaabs and ghouls, taking the fight to the Voldaren estate 
itself.
To build an army of undead requires many corpses. 
Siegfried has a decent supply, but he’ll need more, 
hundreds more to dare challenge the Voldaren family. 
The skaberen has turned his eyes towards Shadowgrange: 
the villagers damned so many with their cowardice. They 
damned all those that disappear in the night with no 
retaliation, all those that begged for help, including his beloved Katarina, who devoted her life to help them.
If the cowards refuse to fight the vampires in life, they’ll 
fight them in death.
Overview
Army of the Damned is divided into four parts. 
In Part 1, “Into Stensia,” the adventurers are on the 
road to the village of Shadowgrange, entering the province 
of Stensia through the Kruin Pass and now journeying 
into the inner valley via the Hofsaddel Pass towards 
Shadowgrange. During this treacherous journey, the 
adventurers may come across deadly foes and potential 
allies, some of these encounters laying hooks for short 
adventures in part 2.
In Part 2, “Shadowgrange,” the characters arrive in 
Shadowgrange to find the village in a state of unrest after 
a brazen vampire attack. The adventurers must enter the 
mayor’s haunted house to retrieve the Church’s holy relic. 
They can also investigate the mystery of the abandoned

Introduction
alchemy shop and help various locals with smaller 
problems.
In Part 3, “Night of the Dead,” the characters must deal 
with approaching undead threat led by ghoulcaller Rinelda. 
They can lead a defence or evacuation of the village. Once 
the zombies have been addressed, the adventurers can 
continue on their main mission of retrieving the artifact 
from Siegfried.
In Part 4, “Into the Farbog,” the characters travel 
through the farbog towards Maur Estate where Siegfried 
resides, wading through spirits and deadly monsters.
In Part 5, “The Perfect Storm,” the characters infiltrate 
Mauer Estate, making their way past its vile defenses until 
confronting Siegfried in his laboratory, where the mad 
scientist is putting the finishing touches on his ultimate 
creation.  
Adventure Hooks
You can let players invent their own reasons for visiting 
Shadowgrange, or they can use the following backgrounds 
as an easy way to create characters with compelling ties to 
the events of Army of the Damned.
Below is a list of bonds that applies to any background 
that players select or create. You can replace or augment 
some or all of the options in your chosen background with 
one or more of the bonds.
BOND (D8)
1. The Church of Avacyn has hired you to make contact 
with Katarina Brunn, a musical prodigy living in 
Shadowgrange, whom they have not heard from in 
months. You must find her and/or retrieve an artifact 
that was under her care.
2. A letter has arrived summoning you to Shadowgrange. 
Your cousin, Siegfried Reinholdt, has fled from 
his home in Shadowgrange under mysterious 
circumstances, and the deed to his property has 
passed to you. Whatever you choose to do with the 
shop, you must travel to Shadowgrange to sign the 
necessary papers. 
3. You have infiltrated the ranks of the demon-
worshipping Skirsdag cult. The cult has found out 
about a secret plan that the Church of Avacyn is carrying 
out, something involving an artifact being held by a 
woman named Katarina living in Shadowgrange. You 
are under orders to investigate this artifact.
4. Sielda Reishaf, an elder of the Avacyn Church and your 
foster parent, has entrusted you with an important 
mission: travel to Shadowgrange and find Katarina 
Brunn. If she is missing, then retrieve the artifact she 
was holding, a so-called “tuning fork.”5. The holy tomb of Saint Traft, one of the most righteous 
and celebrated cathars to walk the land, is located 
in Shadowgrange. You’ve decided to make a holy 
pilgrimage to the saint’s tomb, where it’s said visitors 
occasionally receive aid in the form of prophecy and 
omens.
6. Every few nights, you have a strange sequence of 
apocalyptic dreams where the holy city of Thraben is 
overrun by fiends and undead. Each time, the dream 
ends with you holding a strange object in your hand 
and a silver monument shattering in front of you, 
releasing a flood of light that cleanses the city. You 
feel a strange compulsion to travel to Shadowgrange, 
convinced that the object of your dreams is there.
7. You have a secret. You were once a Skirsdag cultist, 
but at the end of your life you tried to change your 
ways for good. With your dying breath, you prayed to 
the moon for redemption. A vision came to you in the 
shape of a silver heron. It told you to find an artifact 
named the Strionic Resonator in Shadowgrange and 
free Avacyn. You awoke in a new body, your memories 
of your former life but a dim shadow. Only the vision 
with the silver heron remains in your mind with perfect 
clarity.

The adventure begins with the player characters on the 
road, traveling from Thraben to Shadowgrange ( MAP ). 
The journey took them through the province Gavony into 
Stensia via the Kruin Pass, a treacherous pass through the 
mountain range called Geier Reach, which cuts off Stensia 
from the rest of the provinces. The characters journeyed 
through Stensia’s inner valley and now cross Hofsaddel 
pass into the outer valley where Shadowgrange resides.
Before you begin, have your players introduce their 
characters. Let them explain why their characters are 
making the journey from Thraben to Shadowgrange, 
either from one of the preconstructed backgrounds or 
something they’ve made up on their own. When you’re 
ready to begin, read or paraphrase:
Your journey from Thraben to Shadowgrange has been 
relatively safe and mercifully uneventful so far. The road 
drifted across the rolling hills and heaths that make up the 
landscape of province Gavony, taking you through small 
villages and quiet farmlands.
A few days ago you entered Geier Reach, the imposing 
mountain range that cuts Stensia off from its neighboring 
provinces. The trail through it, called Kruin’s Pass, was a 
long, jagged path that cut up and over the mountainsides, 
until finally you entered Stensia proper. The last few 
days had you trek through Stensia’s inner valley, passing 
through the small settlements Silbern, Bourg, and Corsiva,  until earlier today when you crossed the threshold into the 
outer valley via the Hofsaddel Pass. 
The journey continues through Stensia’s outland valley 
along winding stone paths dotted by grim pine trees 
and flanked by the far-flung mountain ranges whose 
boney peaks reach into the cloudy sky. Sprouting from 
one such mountain is a castle with many spires, its 
imposing structure casting a long shadow down from the 
stony peaks. A hazey fog looms over the valleys, lightly 
obscuring objects in the distance. The sky is awash in 
warm orange-red, with dark purplish-red clouds covering 
the setting sun.
In this part of the adventure, the players have just entered 
Stensia’s outland valley via Hofsaddel Pass. The castle 
overlooking the pass is Castle Falkenrath, the home 
base of the Falkenrath vampire bloodline. Common local 
knowledge would know of the castle and the need to avoid 
approaching it closer than necessary.
The journey to Shadowgrange will take two days. 
Road Encounters
Along the way, the characters will partake in four of 
the following events below. These events serve as an 
introduction into the lands, setting the tone of the world, 
feeding little bits of lore to the players, and establishing 
that Stensia is a dangerous place to travel.
Choose four of the events, marking when they occur 
(day/night). Alternatively, roll a D8 and consult the Road

Ancient Devoutees
The adventurers come across the ruins of a small roadside 
chapel, its name long forgotten. 
Tucked between the road and the mountainside are the 
dilapidated remnants of a small chapel. The roof had 
caved in long ago, and the wood and stone foundation 
are half-covered in dirt and vegetation. Shards of colored 
glass from what once were stained glass windows litter 
the ground near the entrance.
With Avacyn’s presence fading from the world, foul magic 
has corrupted the earth here, and the dead have been 
forced to rise. 3 skeletons (MM 272) ( PICTURE ) and 1 
skeleton priest (same stats as skeletons, just reskin its 
shortbow as a magical bolt of nectoric energy) – the 
remains of the chapel’s priest and three cathars that died 
defending it -- are damned to carry out their last holy 
prayers for eternity. When the adventurers approach, the 
skeletons are in the middle of this unending “service.”
If the PCs look inside, read or paraphrase:
Three figures geared in weathered leathers of cathars 
sit on the rotted wooden pews with their heads bowed 
in reverence. Standing in front of them, at the far end of 
the chapel behind a dilapidated podium, is a skeleton 
garbed in tattered priestly robes, its armed outstretched 
ceremoniously. If the skeletal priest notices the PCs, it will gesture them 
to join the service and sit. If the PCs take hostile actions 
or loot the chapel, all the skeletons will attack. If a PC 
tries to put the skeletons to rest with any reasonable idea  
(helping lead the ceremony to its conclusion, for example) 
and succeed a DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check, the 
skeletons collapse and spectral images of their former 
living selves briefly appear, thank the PCs and reward 
them with the tithe bowl (see below) before fading away.
 
Treasure
A thorough search of the chapel ruins and a successful 
DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a silver tithe 
collecting bowl buried in rubble beside the altar. The 
bowl contains 17 cp, 14 sp, and 2 gp, while the ornate 
container itself is worth 15 gp to jewelers or employees of 
the Church. 
While most of the skeletons’ possessions are too rusted 
and decayed, one of the skeletons still grips a silver-inlaid 
dagger  (APPENDIX A) ( PICTURE ).
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the skeletons.
Cloud of Teeth
3 swarms of skeletal bats (APPENDIX B) are flying in 
the adventurer’s direction. They roam the road with the 
singular motive of ripping apart any traveler unfortunate 
enough to come across them.

higher can sense the swarm’s approach 200 ft. away as 
they round the bend. A passive Perception of 14 or higher 
notices them 120 ft. away, and a 12 or higher notices them 
60 ft. away. Finally, all can hear/see the swarm emerging 
from the fog ahead of them 30 ft. away. 
You hear a cascading sound of high-pitched chirps and 
screeches coming from somewhere up ahead. It’s faint 
at first, but slowly rising in volume. There’s a dark blotch 
in the mists in front of you, and now you can hear the 
screeching more clearly, along with the flapping of many 
tiny wings. The dark blotch grows and takes form – it’s a 
cloud of skeletal bats!
The swarms attack any living beings in their way 
mercilessly with tiny razor-sharp bites. Each swarm moves 
to a character, enters their square, and begins attacking. 
They fight to the death.Awarding Experience Points
Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the skeletal bats.
Explosive Summons
A group of Skirsdag cultists have been conducting a ritual 
inside a roadside cave to summon demons into the world. 
The ritual reaches its explosive conclusion as the party 
approaches.
The quiet valley is suddenly filled with a thunderous 
booming sound that rumbles through the earth. A chorus 
of otherworldly screams are heard off in the distance, 
an eerie cry of pain, horror, and celebration. Moments 
later, a large, dark humanoid figure emerges from the 
mountainside up ahead, taking to the air with broad, 
leathery wings. Black smokes streams up into the sky 
from where the figure emerged.
Shilgengar, the demonlord of ashmouth (APPENDIX B) 
(PICTURE ), emerges from the cave where the summoning 
ritual took place, 450 ft. away from the approaching 
adventurers. He hasn’t seen the characters on the road 
and begins flying off north to Mauer Estate. The demon 
shouldn’t take notice of the characters unless the 
adventurers take very foolish steps to grab his attention. 
The adventurers may encounter Shilgengar again in 
Chapter 4.
The cave is not far from the path the adventurers are 
taking. Wisps of black sulfurous smoke streams from the 
cave’s mouth. The stone surfaces inside the cave are badly 
scorched from the fiery summoning. The cave is dimly lit 
by numerous wax candles littering the walls and floor, 
most knocked over from the explosion. Charred corpses 
of several cultists are on the floor, the palms of their hands 
ritually slashed open, their blood used to paint a wide red 
circle on the floor. The stone floor in the middle of the 
bloody circle has fallen through, now a gaping chasm that 
spews heat and sulfurous black smoke. The bottom of the 
chasm is lost in darkness.
When the adventurers investigate the cave or pass it 
by, 2 hellriders  (APPENDIX B) riding 2 ashmouth hounds  
(APPENDIX B) ( PICTURE ) emerge from the chasm and 
attack on sight. They fight to the death.
Leaping out of the chasm with a howl is a monstrous 
fiery hound, its razor-sharp claws and teeth crowned 
with flame. Riding atop this large dog is a small impish 
humanoid with long backswept horns and hard, chitin-
like dark red skin. The fiend grins wide, revealing rows 
of needle-like teeth, its red eyes burning bright with

12anticipation as it yanks the iron reigns of its steed, urging 
it faster towards you.
Developments
Characters investigating the chasm find that the earth has 
resealed the bottom. No more demons will emerge from 
it -- at least until another summoning occurs.
A thorough search of the cultist bodies, along with a 
DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, notices that each 
cultist had been stabbed in the chest. A follow-up DC 10 
Intelligence (Investigation) check notes that each cultist 
was ritually stabbed in the heart with a dagger with no 
signs of struggle, and a check result of 15 or higher notes 
that the killing strokes were delivered hours before the 
ritual completed. The ritual dagger is nowhere to be found.
While most of the cultists that participated in the 
summoning ritual stuck around for its explosive 
conclusion, a Wisdom (Perception) check DC 12 reveals 
two pairs of humanoid footprints that left the cave only 
hours ago. The footprints arrive at a horses’ prints and an 
Intelligence (Nature) check DC 10 confirms that they rode 
off in the direction of Shadowgrange.
These two surviving cultists are Shadowgrange 
residents Otto and Magda Botler. They ritually killed the 
other willing cultists to complete the summoning and left 
before the ritual finished. The characters may encounter 
these two in the next chapter.
Treasure
If characters loot the cultist bodies, they’ll find a total of 25 
cp, 18 sp, and 12 gp. 
One of the cultists also carries a gilded ram’s horn. It’s 
worth 25 gp to the right (shady) buyer.  Etched on its side 
is a symbol that characters can identify with an Intelligence 
(Religion) check DC 15 -- the symbol of the archdemon 
Griselbrand, the most venerated demon of the Skirsdag.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 250 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the hellriders and ashmouth hounds.
Fiendish Hecklers
3 smoke mephits  (MM 217) follow the characters as they 
journey through the valley. 
You hear snickering and cackling coming from your left, 
echoing off the mountain range. A raspy, shrill voice calls 
out, “you don’t want to go that way! You’ll die too soon 
and spoil our fun!” Looking left, you notice three black 
figures hovering in the air. The small impish creatures 
billow smoke from their hazy bodies. The mephits keep out of the party’s attack range, defaulting 
to a distance of about 100ft. from the adventurers. They 
flee if attacked, only to sneak back with their Stealth +4. 
They’d much rather verbally attack the adventurers than 
get physical.
The elementals try to mislead the adventurers to make 
them go the wrong way or doubt themselves. They could 
“warn” them of a dead-end up ahead, or of a powerful 
demon preying on the road, always fabrications. 
The mephits constantly mock the characters at 
every opportunity. They’ll insult the studious wizard’s 
intelligence, call the strong barbarian weak, and complain 
about the bard’s terrible music. They love getting a rise 
out of characters, even if they are destroyed in the process.
Developments
If the adventurers are preoccupied fighting in a different 
combat encounter and seem to be winning, one of the 
mephits will sneak up to an adventurer furthest from 
his or her allies (typically a ranged character) and use its 
Cinder Breath before flying away, cackling. Smoke mephits 
are total jerks like that.
The mephits stalk the adventurers relentlessly until all 
of them are destroyed or the party reaches Shadowgrange 
(maybe even longer!).
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 150 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the mephits.
Into Darkness
At night, 2 shadows  (MM 269) begin to stalk the party. 
They will try to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to hide 
in the party’s shadows, waiting until they are split up or 
sleeping before attacking. The shadows are drawn to the 
characters that radiate the most goodness in terms of 
lifestyle, attitude, and personality. For example, they will 
prioritize attacking the good-aligned paladin over the 
neutral wizard.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the shadows.
Ominous Bridge
The land ahead drops off into a dark, stony ravine. A 
dilapidated bridge offers the most obvious way over. 
Aside for the chunks of missing stone and its ruinous 
appearance, the bridge is sturdy enough. That is not the 
true danger, however. A giant spider  (MM 328) and giant 

--- Page 13 ---
13
Chapter 1: Into Stensia
wolf spider (MM 330) ( PICTURE ) lay in wait on the bridge’s 
underbelly. Thin strands of nearly invisible webbing 
coating the bridge alerts the spiders to any movement on 
top. The spiders instinctively attack anything that disturbs 
their webs, but flee if taken below half their health points.
A Wisdom (Perception) check DC 15 notices the thin 
webbing on the bridge. An Intelligence (Nature) check DC 
10 confirms the webbing to belong to giant spiders. Taking 
a peek under the bridge (hopefully not too close!) can 
spot the spiders lurking in the shadows with a Wisdom 
(Perception) check DC 20.
Webs.  Thin webs cover the surface of the bridge. The 
squares are difficult terrain, and a creature trying to 
move through them must succeed on a DC 10 Strength 
(Athletics) check. On a failure, the creature is restrained in 
the webs. A snared creature can take an action each round 
to attempt to break free with a DC 12 Strength check, or 
it can try to cut its way free by using a light weapon that 
deals slashing damage. The webs have AC 10, 5 hit points, 
vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, 
poison, and psychic damage.
Developments
Characters can choose to avoid the bridge and spiders 
entirely and navigate down into the ravine and back up 
the other side, adding several hours to their journey. It 
takes a Strength (Athletics) check DC 10 to climb up or 
down the ravine walls.
Treasure
Three web cocoons are stuck on the bridge’s underside. 
Adventurers looking under the bridge can notice the 
cocoons tucked into shallow pits with a Wisdom 
(Perception) check DC 20. Reaching the cocoons is 
another challenge altogether. If they come up with a way 
to do so and loot the dessicated corpses, they’ll find 30 cp, 
27 sp, and 8 gp in coins, emerald-encrusted earings and  
a gold necklace with a tear-shaped ruby together worth 30 
gp total, and a potion of healing .
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 250 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the giant spiders or goes around them.
Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing
The party arrives at a roadside shrine. Before, these 
shrines provided travellers a safe haven, its protective 
magics warding the immediate area from evil creatures. 
But with the archangel Avacyn’s disappearance, the holy 
magic of the shrine has gone dormant.The jagged stone road curves around a stony peak. As you 
round the bend, you see an alcove in the mountainside. 
In the middle of the alcove, bursting through the rocky 
ground, is a wide pine tree stump. Carved from what used 
to be its trunk and rising up from its stump is the symbol 
of the Church: Avacyn’s Collar. Wild flowers, wooden 
trinkets, and prayer beads adorn the shrine.
Kneeling in prayer in front of the shrine is a pale sweaty 
human wearing dirty, torn shepherd’s clothing.
The praying man is Anton Wepper ( PICTURE ), a shepherd 
from the village Lammas. Anton carries a dark secret: a 
few nights ago he was bitten by a werewolf  and cursed 
with lycanthropy  (MM 206). Fearing for the safety of his 
loved ones, he left his home and is making the trek to 
Shadowgrange, hoping to pick up supplies there and then 
continue on to the farbog to live in isolation. Anton has 
been praying ceaselessly to Avacyn hoping not to let the 
curse take hold, but unknown to him, tomorrow night is a 
full moon, which will cause him to involuntarily transform 
into a werewolf.
Anton is initially fearful of the PCs but can be calmed 
down if they prove they aren’t vampires or other monsters. 
If Anton finds out that they’re going to Shadowgrange, he 
begs to come along, as the road is dangerous. He tells 
them that he’s stopping by Shadowgrange to start a new 
life, which is vague but true. If pressed about his motives, 
he lies, saying that he inherited land near Shadowgrange 
and he is traveling to sign papers. He’s also willing 
to provide any local knowledge about Stensia, basic 
information about important locations, rumors, dangers 
on the road, and other bits of local knowledge.
A Wisdom (Insight) check DC 13 can notice that the 
nervous shepherd is withholding information. A Wisdom 
(Perception) check DC 15 notices a burn mark in the shape 
of Avacyn’s Collar on his wrist (Anton hides it under his 
sleeve). An Intelligence (Religion) check DC 13 confirms 
that the signs point to lycanthropy. An Intelligence 
(Nature) check DC 13 confirms the next full moon for 
tomorrow night. Getting Anton to speak truly about his 
curse can be done through diplomacy, intimidation, and 
other methods. 
Developments
The shrine’s divine magic lays dormant. A character can 
spend an hour performing the proper holy rituals with 
an Intelligence (Religion) check DC 15 to reactivate the 
divine magic. Doing so grants anyone resting at the shrine 
an Inspiration Point, and evil creatures are compelled not 
to approach the shrine’s immediate vicinity. 
Anton is a good man but afraid to die. If the party figures 
out his curse, he begs them to help, swearing that he is 
faithful to Avacyn and doesn’t want to hurt anyone. He 

--- Page 14 ---
14needs them to escort him to Shadowgrange where he can 
pick up supplies and escape north into the swamps, away 
from human civilization.
If he feels his life is threatened, Anton will make a 
desperate attempt to defend himself. He is a commoner 
(MM 345) with a light crossbow. 
The next night, when the full moon rises, he transforms 
into a werewolf  (MM 211), losing all self-control and goes 
on a murderous rampage.
Treasure
Anton carries a small sack of coins holding 15 cp, 4 sp, and 
1 gp. In the shepherd’s coat pocket is his most treasured 
possession, an avacyn collar (APPENDIX A) ( L). Anton 
can no longer wear it as blessed silver  burns his flesh. If 
the characters agree to let him travel with them, he gives 
them the chain as thanks before parting ways.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 300 XP equally among the characters once they’ve 
dealt with Anton any way they choose. In the event that 
they defeat him once he’s transformed into a werewolf, 
instead divide 600 XP.Conclusion of Part 1
On the end of the third day of travel, the party arrives at 
Shadowgrange, where the adventure continues in part 2.
Awarding Experience Points
Reaching the village of Shadowgrange completes a story 
milestone. Divide 300 XP equally among the characters. 
This should provide enough XP for the characters to attain

Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
 Art by Vincent Proce
Shadowgrange ( MAP ) is one of the oldest human 
settlements in Stensia. Most of the villagers are farmers, 
the majority being shepherds. The rest of the villagers 
work in trades that support the farmers by spinning wool, 
weaving clothes, shoeing horses, milling grain, and the 
like. Some merchants move goods from Shadowgrange to 
other settlements such as Lammas, but shipments move 
less frequently these days as the roads become more 
dangerous.
In the last two years, Shadowgrange has experienced 
a swell of new citizens that sought refuge behind the 
village’s fortifications. Most of these folk come from 
smaller remote villages that have been destroyed by 
over-indulgent vampires, mindless undead, or sadistic 
ghoulcallers. With Avacyn’s presence missing from the 
land, the protective holy wards of these villages are failing, 
and creatures of the night are making bolder attacks. 
Shadowgrange’s moat and stone walls make it one of 
the best defended villages in the area, but many villagers 
secretly believe that this settlement will eventually fall just 
like the rest.
When characters first arrive in Shadowgrange, read or 
paraphrase:
The valley dips downward and you see dozens of sheep 
flocks roaming the thin, wispy hills, with shepherds 
watching over them. Beyond, nestled in a corner beside 
the jagged mountain range, is Shadowgrange. The dirt 
path swings around farms and wooden cottages until it 
reaches the village’s moat, where sheep  gather round for a drink. Beyond the drawbridge over the water stands an 
iron-reinforced wooden gate flanked by two guards, the 
only way through Shadowgrange’s stone walls. A small 
grove of hawthorn trees grows near the moat and more 
branches can be seen poking over the village walls.
2 guards  (MM 347), twin brothers Lars and Sven, stand 
watch outside of the village gates. These cathars hail the 
adventurers as they approach over the drawbridge. In a 
cold formal tone, they check to see if the characters are 
fiends by asking them to give them the palm of their hand, 
which they touch with an avacyn collar  made of blessed 
silver (APPENDIX A). 
Once satisfied that the characters aren’t supernatural 
abominations, the guards, Lars animates dramatically, 
tossing aside his formal speech and tries to chum it up 
with the newcomers, much to the bemoaning of Sven, 
who deems this “unprofessional.” Lars is a lighthearted 
and curious fellow, rarely seeing strangers in the area, 
and the adventurers intrigue him. The twins are willing to 
provide local knowledge to the characters and point them 
in the direction of wherever they need to go.
Encounters in 
Shadowgrange
The party will probably want to freshen up after their 
long journey to Shadowgrange. They can rest at the inn, 
restock their supplies at the general shop, acquire new 
weapons at the blacksmith, and receive divine blessings 
at the village church. The party’s goals will then lead them 
to one or more of the following locations:
Haunted House. All adventure hooks involving Katarina 
Brunn or the holy relic lead to the haunted house of the 
former mayor. Villagers questioned about these things 
direct the PCs to Priestess Flora at the chapel where they 
can get more information.
Alchemist’s Shop. Siegfried’s alchemy shop has been 
abandoned ever since he left Shadowgrange. The villagers 
are concerned about Siegfried’s disappearance, and that 
the hawthorn tree growing in the center of the shop is 
mysteriously dying. Any inquiries about the shop are 
directed to Captain Levi at the visgaud grounds.
Saint Traft’s Memorial.  Inside Shadowgrange’s chapel 
is a statue commemorating the local saint, Traft. One of 
the greatest cathars to have ever lived, it’s said that his 
spirit occasionally bestows blessings on worthy visitors. 
Characters making pilgrimage to Traft’s memorial will be 
pointed here.Part 2: Shadow grange

Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
16Important NPCs
Here is a quick summary of the most important NPCs in 
Shadowgrange, and their relevance to the adventure.Town Description
Most of the villagers live on their farms outside of 
Shadowgrange’s walls. The tradesfolk and wealthier 
citizens live inside. Each cottage is built around a 
hawthorn tree, with the tree’s trunk in the center of the 
common room and its branches poke above the rooftop. 
This provides residents centralized access to living wood 
(APPENDIX A) as a defense against vampires. Every 
cottage also features a mirror on the outside of the front 
door to dissuade vampires from approaching, and often 
have prayers to Avacyn engraved on the door frame to 
repel evil spirits.
The following section detail specific locations in town.
Silver Rose Inn
Silver Rose Inn is a popular destination in the evening for 
villagers taking a break after a long day’s work. Most folk 
head back home before nightfall, however, as the roads 
are far more dangerous once the sun goes down. 
There are eight rooms available for rent. If the characters 
decide to stay here, see “Food, Drink, and Lodging” in the 
Player’s Handbook  for pricing (PHB 158).
The innkeeper, Eckhardt Sheck, is a former cathar 
(statted as a Neutral Good thug  [MM 350]). Although in 
his mid 50’s with thin greying blonde hair, he is remains 
an imposing figure; his thick, muscled, hairy arms look 
like they could snap a regular man in two, or at least they 
could if he had a right hand instead of a grasping hook 
-- he lost it fighting off a swarm of ghouls, nasty business. 
His permanent scowl and gruff attitude hides his kind 
heart.
If asked about Katarina Brunn, the artifact from the 
Avacynian Church, or Saint Traft’s memorial, Eckhardt 
tells them to speak with priestess Flora at the village 
church, saying that she would know more about those 
things than anyone else.
Rumors.  Spending a little time in the common room and 
chatting up the townspeople can provide the characters 
with a number of good leads to explore around the village. 
NPCs present in the Silver Rose Inn and the rumors they 
pass on include:
• Gerold, an old farmer: “Priestess Flora is still looking 
for tough folks to try and purge the spirits in the old 
mayor’s house.”
• Lena, a shepherd: “The hawthorne tree the alchemist 
shop is built around looks to be dying. Someone 
needs to check out what’s killing it.”
• Merle, a cathar: “I placed an order for a blessed silver 
longsword months ago. Marcus, the blacksmith, says 
there’s a shortage though.”
• Carsten, a priest: “Last week I prayed at Saint Traft’s 
memorial in the chapel, and I swear by Avacyn’s Light, Eckhardt Sheck

Roleplaying Shadowgrange NPCs
The humans of Shadowgrange are stoic folk, neither 
expressive nor demonstrative people. Countless 
generations of hardship and proximity to the vampire 
strongholds – lost children, lost neighbors – have taught 
them to guard their hearts. They are proud and fervent in 
their beliefs but seem brusque or even cold to outsiders.
Times have been particularly rough these past few 
seasons with the disappearance of Avacyn. The holy wards 
protecting humanity are losing power, and the villagers 
are becoming more paranoid and fearful as attacks from 
creatures of the night become bolder and more frequent. 
Shadowgrange is becoming more crowded as they take 
in refugees from neighboring villages that have fallen to 
darkness, and the stress of accommodating more people 
to protect and mouths to feed is worsening their tempers.
Spirits are at an all-time low with the murder of the 
mayor four months ago. The villagers stood frozen in fear 
as Voldaren vampires strolled into their village, murdered 
their mayor, and kidnapped Katarina (See “Background”). 
That event really drove home the knowledge that the 
people of Shadowgrange are truly helpless in the face of 
the horrors around them. Fear and shame have kept them 
from even clearing out the mayor’s haunted house.
People feel a little resentment towards Thraben, the seat 
of the Avacynian Church. They believe the high priesthood 
isn’t doing enough to protect Stensians, instead getting 
wealthy off tithes and living in safety behind Thraben’s 
walls while places like Shadowgrange suffer.
Martial and magical prowess is highly prized in 
humanity’s fight for survival. Villagers are initially wary 
of the characters but the adventurers quickly earn their 
respect and admiration if they prove to be protecting 
them -- clearing the haunted house, for example. Gruff 
“off you go then” goodbyes turn into “Avacyn’s blessings 
upon you, heroes.”

Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
I saw his spirit!”
• Martin, village idiot: “Old man Otto at Bountiful 
Heron General Store keeps complaining that there’s 
no one to talk to about the ‘R’ canes. Where do you 
think those grow, anyway?”
• Helga, innkeeper’s wife: “Silvia, the fletcher, told me 
yesterday she needs a certain type of wild herb, but 
she hasn’t had the time to go get it.”
These leads should point the characters toward 
opportunities for adventure in and around Shadowgrange.
Bountiful Heron General Store
Bountiful Heron is the biggest trading post in 
Shadowgrange. Its shelves are stocked with ordinary 
goods and supplies. Characters can buy adventuring 
gear here, with the exception of items worth over 25g. 
(For prices, see “Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook.) Characters in need of metal weapons or armor are pointed 
to The Tempered Bull, and ranged weapons or leathers 
inquiries are nudged towards Fleeting Fox Provisions (see 
their respective sections).
The owners are an old married couple, Otto and Magda 
Botler. They are kind to the characters, Magda often calling 
them “dear” or “sweetie.” Otto sits behind the counter 
fussing over old scrolls and tomes of arcane knowledge. 
Magda works the counter, feebly moving over to get 
anything the characters ask for with trembling hands. 
Their feeble movements and kindness are a ruse, however. 
A DC 25 Wisdom (Insight) check notices that their actions 
aren’t entirely sincere – Magda and Otto have honed their 
“kind old people” act for over a decade. If confronted 
about it, the couple tries to laugh it off, saying pretending 
to be feeble gets people to do things for them. 
Otto and Magda are secretly two Skirsdag cultists. Magda 
is a cult fanatic  (MM 345) and Otto a mage  (MM 347). The 
two came to Shadowgrange to steal Elbrus, the Binding 
Map by Sean Ellison

--- Page 18 ---
Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
18Blade  (APPENDIX A) from Saint Traft’s Memorial. Now 
with the dagger in their possession, they work tirelessly 
to release the demon lord Withengar from the dagger. 
They recently made a trek outside of Shadowgrange to 
help perform a demon summoning ritual alongside fellow 
cultists (see “Explosive Summoning” in Chapter 1). 
Arcane Appreciation.  Otto takes special note of any 
character clearly showing arcane talents – casting an 
arcane spell, carrying an arcane spellbook, etc. Few folks 
around here have knowledge of the arcane, and Otto 
excitedly peppers the character(s) with questions about 
their background, studies, and goals in their pursuit of 
arcane knowledge. If the character is proficient with 
Intelligence (Arcane), allow him or her to roll an Arcane 
check during their talk with Otto, provided they are willing 
to answer his questions. On a result of 10 or higher, Otto 
gifts them a scroll of comprehend languages , saying 
that he hasn’t had a use for it and hopes it may help the 
budding spellcaster ; on a 15 or higher he is so impressed 
with the character’s knowledge that he also gifts them a 
scroll of burning hands  and a scroll disguise self .
An Innocent Gift.  Otto and Magda know that Elbrus, the 
Binding Blade  requires many souls to awaken Withengar. It 
would be very difficult to kill enough people to unleash the 
demon lord without blowing their cover. The adventurers 
arriving in town presents a unique opportunity to pass the 
blade off to professional killers that will surely fulfill the 
dagger’s soul quota and unleash Withengar for them. 
Otto will take any good opportunity to put Elbrus in the 
party’s hands, either by initially offering to sell them it for 
50 gp, or later by gifting the characters it after they aid 
the village in some significant way, such clearing out the 
mayor’s house or helping the people during the zombie 
attack. 
Elbrus takes the innocent looking form of the 
Shapeshifter’s Blade  (PICTURE ). Otto describes it as a 
weapon that changes form based on the user’s thoughts 
(which is true), and that he picked it up along his travels 
but never had a use for physical weapons (also true).
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if a party 
member talks arcane magics with lonely old Otto.
The Tempered Bull
Physical danger is a fact of life for Stensians, and most 
villagers have weapons ready to protect themselves from 
the creatures of darkness. Shadowgrange’s forge runs hot 
from the crack of dawn until late into the night, smithing 
new weapons and repairing damaged ones.
Marcus Ritter, the head blacksmith, is busy tempering 
a blade, assisted by six apprentices. The black-haired, silver-eyed man is remarkably young for his position. An 
exceptional smith, his apprenticeship was cut short when 
the previous blacksmith was found burnt to a crisp; rumor 
has it that he cremated his late wife and she returned to 
take vengeance upon him as a fiery geist. Marcus was 
given the position shortly after.
Characters can buy metal arms and armor here. (For 
prices, see “Equipment” in the rulebook.)
Quest: Blessed Silver Shortage.  Marcus used to create 
weapons of blessed silver  (see APPENDIX A) with the help 
of the late mayor, Ralph Brunn. With his death months 
ago, however, no one else in the village knows the holy 
ritual to bless the silver as the weapons are being forged. 
Marcus has asked for help from Thraben but has received 
no response. Without new blessed silver  weapons, the 
village is ill-prepared to defend themselves against 
supernatural horrors. The blacksmith asks if any of the 
characters know how to perform the ritual.
A character that has proficiency in Intelligence (Religion) 
can attempt a DC 15 check to see if they can perfectly recall 
the holy ritual. If they do, the character can assist Marcus 
in creating a batch of blessed weapons, which takes 10 
hours uninterrupted.
If they are successful, Marcus gifts the character one 
of the weapons as thanks. The character can choose any 
metal weapon (see “Weapons” in the rulebook) as their 
gifted blessed silver  weapon. 
Characters can purchase additional blessed silver 
weapons  for the standard price of silver weapons (weapon 
price + 100 gp for silver). Marcus is thankful for their help, 
but the blacksmith cannot give his weapon stock away for 
free, since this is the livelihood of him and his apprentices.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if a party 
member helps Marcus craft blessed silver weapons.
Fleeting Fox Provisions
Three sisters, a fletcher named Silvia, a bowyer named 
Emma, and a leatherworker named Sybille, are co-owners 
of this shop. They keep the village’s hunters armed and 
protected to venture into the dangerous wilderness.
Not only do they run the shop, but these sisters are also 
the most talented hunters in the village. The silver-haired 
women move with an uncanny grace, and despite their 
advanced age (all in their 50’s), they retain the youthful 
appearance of women half their age. For these reasons, the 
trio have earned the nickname “Moontouched Sisters.”
Characters can buy ranged weapons, ammo, and 
leather armors here. (For prices, see “Equipment” in the 
rulebook.)
Quest: Find the Lotus. Silvia asks that if the party finds

serves as the town hall, courtroom jail, and Town  Guard 
headquarters, housing twenty of the militia that protect 
the village (the rest have small cabins of their own in and 
around town).
Beside the building is the cathars’ training grounds, 
where off-duty militia train on target dummies or in 
practice duels with wooden swords. 
Captain Levi ( PICTURE ) (statted as a Lawful Good 
thug  [MM 350]) is the leader of Shadowgrange’s militia, 
being promoted to that position shortly after Katarina’s 
kidnapping. A middle-aged veteran fighter trained in 
Elgaud Grounds in Nephalia, Levi is a strong and capable 
leader charged with protecting the village as best he can.
Alchemy Shop Investigation.  Levi is aware that some 
townsfolk are concerned about the mysteriously dying 
hawthorn tree at the center of the abandoned alchemy 
shop. He considers it a nonissue and doesn’t want to deal 
with it, arguing his time is better spent on more pressing 
issues, like training new recruits and other administration 
work. If a PC asks to investigate the shop, or if they have 
the deed to the shop, Levi is happy to let them check it 
out.themselves in the farbog to the north, to keep an eye out 
for a plant called Sanguine Lotus. She has a recipe that 
uses the plant’s flower to create a healing salve called 
life’s blood  (see APPENDIX A). The lotus only flowers for 
a few weeks this time of year, and she doesn’t have the 
time to venture out and collect them herself. She will pay 
gold for them, along with some of the salve.
Characters proficient in Intelligence (Nature) will be 
prompted to make a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check 
while traveling through the farbog in Chapter 4. On 
success, they’ll find sanguine lotus. If they characters 
bring the lotus back to Silvia, she will grind the flowers 
into life’s blood , giving the party two vials of it along with 
50 gp.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 200 XP equally among the characters if the party 
retrieves sanguine lotus for Silvia.
Visgaud Grounds
The sturdiest building in Shadowgrange is this old stone 
house built near the village gates. Visgaud Grounds 


--- Page 20 ---
Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
20Armory
A small stone tower adjacent to Visgaurd Grounds, about 
30 feet tall, the armory holds arms and armor for the 
town militia -- spears, light wooden shield, leather armor, 
studded leather amor, and a few old longswords and 
crossbows. Most of the arms have already been issued to 
the members of the militia.
An ancient hawthorn tree with an unusually thick trunk 
grows beside the armory. Villagers call it the Eldentree. 
The cathars maintain the tree and diligently carve the 
outline of stakes and spears into its trunk. In times of 
need, these weapons are cut out of the Eldentree, which 
function as weapons of living wood  (APPENDIX A) for the 
next two days.
Chapel
Shadowgrange’s chapel is the focal point of the village. 
Most villagers worship here several times per week, and 
many pass by the church on a daily basis for a blessing of 
safety. Mandatory tithes and payments for blessings keep 
the church’s coffers always full.
Priestess Flora ( PICTURE ), a priestess  (MM 348), 
oversees the day-to-day administration at the church with 
the help of a few lower-ranking clergy members. She is 
usually busy throughout the day, leading the morning and 
evening sermons, blessing the villagers, and performing 
divine rituals to reinforce Shadowgrange’s protective 
wards. An old, oddly talkative woman, Flora stands out 
amongst the majority of Stensians by being outwardly 
warm and welcoming. 
If asked about Katarina Brunn or the artifact, Flora 
will take the characters aside and tell them the story of 
what happened to the mayor’s daughter -- paraphrase 
the information from “Background: Voldaren’s Lesson,” 
leaving out information about the artifact itself. She knows 
that Katarina was studying something of grave importance 
for the high priests, but she doesn’t know what the artifact 
is, only that it would’ve been kept somewhere in the house.
Saint Traft’s Memorial. Flora is happy to show Saint 
Traft’s memorial to any inquiring character. She fondly 
recalls the saint’s story; how he reached Sainthood in life, 
how even angels would fight under his command, and 
his heroic death single-handedly fighting cultists and the 
demon-lord Withengar to protect a single innocent life. 
(Saint Traft’s entire story can be read  here. )
Inside this small room is Saint Traft’s memorial, dimly 
lift by dozens of wax candles. In the middle of the room 
is a statue of Saint Traft. He appears as a strong, valiant 
middle-aged man taking a knee in prayer while steadying a 
greatsword in hand. Soaring above him with outstretched 
feathery wings is an angel in a silken gown, holding an ornate spear high above her head as if to rally those that 
look up at her. A silver plaque at the base of the statue 
reads, “Here lies Saint Traft, champion of Avacyn, hero of 
Shadowgrange.”
On the back wall of the room is a display case made 
of glass and iron, surrounded by etchings on the walls, 
hymns and prayers to Avacyn. Inside the case rests a bone 
dagger with black engravings along its blade. A small 
plaque on the case reads, “A hero’s sacrifice: may the foul 
demon Withengar suffer for an eternity in this prison.”
Saint Traft’s restless spirit manifests throughout Stensia, 
protecting innocents and vanquishing fiends much as 
he did in life. The powerful aura of fate hanging onto the 
adventurers is likely to draw his attention.
The display case is locked; a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of 
Hand) is required to open it. It is watched over by Flora, 
who replenishes the holy wards around it and keeps a 
permanent Alarm spell cast on the case to be alerted if 
anyone opens it. Flora does not permit anyone to touch 
the dagger, explaining that it holds the bound essence of 
the demon lord Withengar and is not something to be 
tampered with.
The dagger inside is Elbrus, the Binding Blade  – or 
at least it was, until Otto and Magda Botler stole it and 
replaced it with a forgery (see “Bountiful Heron General 
Store”). It’s such a convincing duplicate that Flora has 
never noticed the switch. The only big giveaway is that the 
duplicate is a mundane item, while the real thing radiates 
magic, something a character may notice with the Detect 
Magic  spell or similar.
Quest: Saint Traft’s Favor.  Traft’s spirit takes note of the 
adventurers when they visit his shrine. The spirit senses 
that these characters will play a pivotal role in restoring 
balance to the land and seeks to aid them. At some point 
later in the adventure of your choosing (perhaps after the 
siege of Chapter 3), Traft appears to one of the characters of 
your choice in their dream. The spirit chooses a character 
that pays respect at the shrine, or one that is most likely 
to wield a spear in battle, or that acts in a Lawful and/or 
Good manner. When that character next sleeps, read or 
paraphrase:
The spectral figure of a noble human approaches you in 
your dream. His blue wispy form is perpetually shifting, as 
if being buffeted by an unfelt breeze. The ghostly human’s 
features matches exactly the statue of Saint Traft you saw 
before: it must be his spirit.
“I sense the heavy mantle of fate resting on the 
shoulders of you and your allies,” the spirit in an oddly 
comforting tone, “you shall play a role in bringing balance 
to this world. Unfortunately, my hold on the mortal world 
is weak during these dark times, but I shall help you how 

--- Page 21 ---

Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
I can.”
A statuesque angel in a silken gown lands beside you 
and hands you a silvery spear.
“This weapon shall aid you. Stay strong, traveler. We’ll 
meet again.”
Traft and the angel fade back into the darkness.
When the adventurer wakes up, they find the moonsilver 
spear (APPENDIX A) ( PICTURE ) from their dream gripped 
in hand. 
Quest: Haunted House.  If not approached with any hooks, 
Flora instead seeks out the characters herself. She has a 
job for them: rid the mayor’s house of its evil presence. 
Regardless of how they solve the problem, Flora rewards 
them with 200 gp and, if they haven’t been awarded 
possession of the alchemy shop already, she offers them 
to take anything they find in there.
Alchemist’s Shop
Hanging above the front door of this small cabin is a 
wooden sign with a potion painted on it. Like most of the 
buildings here, a hawthorn tree pokes out of the cabin’s 
roof in the center, but its barren branches and greying 
bark signals that it’s dying.
This shop has been abandoned ever since its owner, the 
alchemist Siegfried Reinholdt, fled from the village after 
Katarina’s kidnapping (see “Background” for details). 
The shelves around the shop are stocked with alchemical 
reagents. Semi-precious gems, pickled animal body parts 
such as newt eyes, and many plants can be found here, 
though most of the once-live vegetation has withered and 
died due to months of neglect. In total, there’s about 350 
gp worth of alchemical materials that can be used for crafting potions (See “Crafting” in the rulebook). 
Along the counter is a smattering of devices, among 
them ten empty vials and stoppers, a herbalism kit , and 
alchemist’s supplies . (See “Tools” in the rulebook for 
their stats.)
Hanging on the back wall is a shelf with potions. Some 
of the liquids have expired, but there are four vials of acid , 
three potions of healing , and two alchemist’s fire . (See 
“Adventuring Gear” in the rulebook for their stats.)
There is a fireplace with various iron mixing pots 
hanging over the pit. Inside one of the pots is a muddy 
liquid that has little bits of scales, pink flesh, a small claw, 
and hair. A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) reveals it to be a 
potion of animal friendship  (DMG 187).
Developments
A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices 
some hastily concealed ashen footprints leading from 
the fireplace and out the door. A DC 15 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check examining the fireplace notices a 
hidden lever. Pulling the lever slides a hidden door in the 
fireplace, revealing a narrow spiraling staircase that leads 
to the Alchemist’s Basement.
Alchemist’s Basement
The hidden stone staircase is a short flight of stairs, 
revealing the alchemist shop’s basement. It’s pitch black 
here; the characters will need a light source or darkvision 
to see. Assuming vision, they see this:
The short flight of stairs ends just under the shop.The 
withering roots of the hawthorn tree takes up the center 
of the room and sprawls all across the floor. The roots are 
covered in vines and dead shrubbery.
Along the walls on both your sides are strange 
alchemical devices, glass bottles of various shapes and

Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
22sizes filled with strange liquids, tubes connecting them 
with each other and others burying themselves amid the 
tree’s roots.
Beside the back wall is a wooden desk with piles of 
papers covering its surface along with a leather-bound 
book. Beside the desk is a humanoid figure laying down 
on a metal platform with dozens of utensils littering its 
sides.
That’s no ordinary vegetation growing amongst the roots; 
it’s actually comprised of 5 twig blights and 1 vine blight  
(MM 32). These plant monsters were part of Siegfried’s 
experiments to create effective weapons against vampires, 
as they are, in a sense, walking living wood (see APPENDIX 
A). 
The blights lay motionless on the ground, making them 
indistinguishible from normal vegetation. They patiently 
wait until the characters are distracted searching the 
room (or they’re discovered) and then attack. The plants 
are hungry, having already devoured most of the nutrients 
from the hawthorn tree while locked down here, and fight 
until destroyed.
Developments
A leather-bound book rests on the desk; Siegfried’s journal. 
The entries describe his love of his Stensian countrymen, 
praising their bravery and perserverence. and above 
all, his love of Katarina, the light of his life. He outlines 
dozens of plans to protect his people from the horrors of 
the night, especially from the horrible vampires that prey 
on humanity like cattle. Siegfried devoted his life to this 
endeavor, discarding what didn’t work and always trying 
out new ideas. The final entries note Siegfried’s increasingly 
desperate situation now that Avacyn disappeared and her 
protective magics fail; the horrors grow bolder and more 
of his people die. He ultimately resolves to pursue the foul 
“art” of necro-alchemy, believing it to be a necessary evil 
to protect his loved ones.
The desk is covered with a seemingly endless amount 
of pages discussing necro-alchemy; the art of creating 
undead abominations called “skaabs.” Standing out 
amongst the notes is one opened letter (APPENDIX C). 
The letter is encoded: deciphering the requires Letter 
Frequency Analysis to break the code; for example, 
wherever the letter “z” appears it should be replaced with 
the letter “a,” replacing each letter this way reveals the 
hidden message. You can run this puzzle multiple ways:
• The players figure out and translate the entire letter 
themselves
• The players figure out and translate a portion of the 
letter, then hand them the fully decoded version
• Let the characters make an Intelligence (Investigation) 
DC 15 check to crack the codeThe letter is written by Siegfried’s cousin, a man that 
goes by “Stitcher Geralf.” The cousin voices his support 
of Siegfried’s decision to finally study necro-alchemy and 
suggests he move his operations to a place called Mauer 
Estate.
On the metal platform rests a well-preserved human 
corpse -- or rather, many pieces of human corpses stitched 
together. Copper plates with silver-inlaid runes scribed on 
them have been woven into the creature, the rune-bonds 
used to join the various anatomical features. The strange 
liquid in most of the glass bottles is the vital fluid, the 
“blood” of the skaab, made of lamp oil with a pinch of 
angel blood. Siegfried had this test skaab properly built, 
but he never uttered the incantation to awaken it.
Treasure
Sitting in a corner of the basement is an alchemy jug 
(DMG 150). Siegfried used the jug to produce the oil 
needed for the skaab’s vital fluid.
The various necro-alchemical equipment that Siegfried 
amassed in the basement could be worth 500 gp to fellow 
stitchers, but commoners and members of the Church of 
Avacyn would be hostile to anyone found carrying such 
items.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 325 XP equally among the characters if the party 
destroys the blights.
Mayor’s House
The mayor’s house is a one of the larger and more 
comfortable homes in the village. The two-story building 
is built atop a small hill not far from the chapel and has a 
large hawthorn tree sticking up through its roof.
The house seems ordinary enough until you come close 
and notice that the mirror placed on the wooden door 
has been shattered. Holy protection prayers to Avacyn 
engraved on the door frame have been scratched out with 
a blade, and the door is slightly ajar. The square-framed 
windows reveal nothing on the inside; the house is pitch 
black.
A DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notices about a dozen 
humanoid footprints moving to and from the entrance. 
The vampires smashed the mirror and scratched out the 
holy wards before entering the house.
A dark presence has gripped the house ever since the 
night the vampires attacked (see “Background: Voldaren’s 
Lesson”). 
Magical Darkness.  The insides of the house is enveloped 
in a pitch-black magical darkness that functions as the 
Darkness  spell, except that light sources do work to an

extent, offering dim light within a radius of 15ft. – beyond 
that is total darkness. If the darkness is dispelled, by 
Daylight  or something else, it returns 1d6 rounds later.
Spooky Stuff. In addition to the magical darkness, feel 
free to add any flourishes to this haunted house as you 
see fit. For example, a wall may suddenly begin to bleed, 
the eyes of portraits may follow the PCs, a random PC 
might hear voices or see figures for a brief moment before 
they disappear. Have fun with it!
The Restless Spirit
The late mayor’s restless spirit now haunts the house as a 
poltergeist  (MM 279). Putting him to rest is the only way 
to rid of the house’s haunting.
Ralph senses the character’s intrusion and stalks them 
as they explore the house. Though he moves in complete 
silence and is permanently invisible, the characters feel 
his presense; the air grows cold, a chill runs up their 
spine, and they feel they’re being watched.
Ralph will make his displeasure known if the party 
attempts to loot or otherwise disrespect his home by 
telekintetically shaking or throwing furniture.
Characters can possibly avoid the spirit’s ire by 
convincing Ralph that they are trying to help. By explaining 
that they’re here on behalf of the Church, or that they want 
to help the people of Shadowgrange, or other compelling 
arguments that they can think of, they may be able to get 
Ralph’s spirit to back down and maybe even stop haunting 
the house. If they make a reasonable argument, allow a 
character to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check 
to get Ralph to back down.
Spooky Mirrors. While Ralph is permanently invisible 
to the naked eye as a poltgergeist, his spectral reflection 
still appears in the dozens of mirrors littering the walls 
(PICTURE ).
Ground Floor
Inside, assuming the characters have a light source:
Shards of glass and dried blood litter the entryway floor. 
A hallway leads to two rooms ahead. A bloody handprint 
trails along the wall out of the closest room and onto the 
staircase’s handrail, which spirals up around the large 
hawthorn tree growing in the center of the house and up 
to the second floor.
The two rooms on the main floor are the kitchen in the back 
and the common room. The kitchen has been untouched, 
but the common room is (quite literally) a bloody mess. 
There are clear signs of battle such as slashed furniture 
and scorch marks. Blood splatters cover the walls and 
ceilings. It was here the vampires clashed with Ralph and Katarina.
Slumped beside one of the walls is the decaying corpse 
of Ralph Brunn, the source of all the blood. The vampires 
had some “fun” with him. The mayor’s body still wears 
his mithral chain shirt  (DMG 187) underneath his clothes 
-- not that it helped him in the end.
Second Floor
The staircase leads up to the second floor. The hallway to 
the right leads to two bedrooms: Ralph’s and Katarina’s. 
To the left is the music room, where the hand-smeared 
trail of blood leads to.
Ralph’s bedroom has everything you’d expect in a well-
off village leader’s room. Underneath his bed is a sturdy, 
unlocked wooden chest holding some emergency savings. 
It contains 60 sp, 40 gp, and a silk pouch containing five 
tiger eyes (10 gp each) and two moonstones (50 gp each). 
Amongst the nice variety of clothing in his closet are two 
pairs of priestly cloth-of-gold vestments with Avacyn’s 
Collar embroidered on the front and back, each worth 25 
gp.
Katarina’s bedroom is also fairly mundane. Her 
wardrobe contains a set of battle-worn cathar leathers, 
the uniform of holy warriors of the Church of Avacyn and 
functions as studded leather (see “Armor” in the rule 
book). Unlike her father, Katarina’s closet lacks an array 
of regal clothing; she was more interested in fighting and 
doing in practical clothing instead of playing politics in 
pretty dresses.
There is an unsealed letter tucked into a book on 
Katarina’s desk, which can be found with a thorough 
search of the room and a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) 
check. The letter is written by her and is addressed to 
her uncle, Hanns Reinhart. In it, Katarina begs her uncle 
to come to Shadowgrange at once, as she needs his 
expertise on silver and the moon to unlock a puzzle of 
“great importance.” Apparrently Hanns has disappeared 
for years now, but Katarina is convinced that he is still 
alive somewhere, and this letter is the last of many sent to 
all the safe houses of his that Katarina knows of.
Music Room
The hallway opens up into a large ornate room with an 
arched ceiling. Paintings line the wall, along with smashed 
mirrors. In each corner of the room are instruments: a 
piano with a pile of sheet music placed on it, a violin on 
a stand, a harp, and a bloody flute on the floor next to a 
knocked over music stand.
There are a few music instruments in this room: a piano, 
a bloody flute, a harp, and a violin of banishing light  (see 
APPENDIX A).

--- Page 24 ---
Chapter 2: Shadowgrange
24There are also three paintings: one depicts a canary 
sitting in a rusted bird cage beside a locked chest, another 
shows a flight of angels driving back demons emerging 
from a fiery chasm, and the last one is a portrait of a regal 
looking man with a handlebar mustache; Bernard Brunn, 
grandfather of Ralph Brunn. 
After messily murdering Ralph, a few vampires 
sauntered upstairs for a little entertainment. The bloody-
handed vampire played on the flute for a bit before they 
got bored and left. They also smashed the mirrors so they 
didn’t have to look at their own monstrous reflections.
Music Puzzle
The following is a puzzle using sheet music (APPENDIX 
C) as props. You can run the puzzle multiple ways:
If a a player can read sheet music, let them figure it out
• Bard characters can automatically read sheet music
• Characters proficient in a musical instrument can 
automatically read sheet music
• Silvia, the fletcher at Fleeting Fox Provisions, is known 
in town to be a talented violinist. If the characters ask 
around for someone that can read sheet music, they 
are pointed to her. 
 
The piles of sheet music on the piano are mostly of 
popular songs known to Innistrad natives, but a thorough 
search of the room and an Intelligence (Investigation) 
check DC 15 notices that two sheets of music buried in 
piles of paper stand out from the rest. Both have been 
hurriedly written on with ink (Katarina wrote on them right 
before the impending vampire attack). One says “READ,” 
the other says “PLAY .” Neither of them are songs that a 
local would recognize. See APPENDIX C for copies of the 
sheets. 
The “PLAY” sheet has a song on it that wants to be 
played. Any song will do, but the song used during this 
adventure’s playtest was Pan’s Labyrinth: Lullaby . If anyone 
starts playing the song, either on an instrument, singing, 
or humming, characters feel a sudden compulsion to pick 
up the violin of banishing light . If they do, they find out 
that they can play the song even if they have no experience 
with a violin before. Playing the song activates the violin’s 
magical properties (see APPENDIX A) ( PICTURE ), 
flooding the room with light as the Daylight  spell, and 
driving back the darkness. The Daylight  spell ends as 
soon as the character stops playing.
The “READ” sheet has music notes that, when you look 
at the corresponding letters, spell out “AGED CAGE”. 
One of the paintings on the wall is of a canary sitting in a 
rusted bird cage – an aged cage. Saying, “aged cage,” out 
loud opens the chest in the painting with an audible creak. 
Once opened, a character can reach into the painting 
(which now acts as a portal to a tiny pocket plane) and retrieve from the chest the Strionic Resonator . The artifact 
is not whole: the tuning fork is missing one of its prongs 
(tines). It was cleanly removed; Katarina gave the piece to 
Siegfried for safekeeping the night the vampires attacked, 
gambling that the Voldarens may find one piece, but not 
both.
Developments
When Ralph’s ghost is either destroyed or appeased, the 
darkness shrouding the house disappears. Priestess Flora 
happily pays the party what they’re owed (see “Chapel”) 
and gives them the key to the alchemist’s shop. 
Word quickly spreads throughout the village of the 
party’s deeds. Villagers will be much friendlier to the 
characters, thankful to have strong adventurers in their 
midst during these bleak times.
None of the villagers know what the artifact is, other 
than pointing out that it looks like a tuning fork with a piece 
missing. Flora knows that Katarina was experimenting 
with something on behalf of the Church, and that the only 
other people that may have known about it would be her 
father, Ralph (dead), and her fiancee, Siegfried (fled).
If the characters aren’t tight-lipped about the artifact, 
word about it could spread and may catch the attention 
of dangerous folk (the Skirsdag or worse) that would be 
more than happy to “relieve” the adventurers of their new-
found item.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 450 XP equally among the characters if the party 
deals with Ralph’s spirit.
Divide 1,250 XP equally among the characters if the 
party recovers the Strionic Resonator .
Conclusion of Part 2
Part 3 begins after the adventurers retrieve the Strionic 
Resonator. You may choose to delay Part 3 if the 
adventurers still intend to explore the town further, as this 
may be their final opportunity to do so.
Milestone: Level 3!
If you are using Milestone Experience, then the characters 
attain 3rd level as you move to Part 3.

Chapter 3: Night of the Dead
This chapter begins shortly after the adventurers find the 
Strionic Resonator  in the previous chapter. If the players 
do not have any intention of locating the artifact, or they 
still have other intended goals in town, you may choose to 
start this chapter after the players have had sufficient time 
to rest, explore Shadowgrange, and restock on supplies.
Undead Menace
Events are unfolding beyond the scope of the characters’ 
activities: an army of undead are currently on a murderous 
rampage, laying waste to all the settlements in their way. 
Shadowgrange is their ultimate target.
The Horde’s Purpose
The army is a mad project crafted by Siegfried, an alchemist 
that formerly called Shadowgrange his beloved home. Siegfried had devoted his life to defending the village from 
the horrors that stalk Stensia; most of all, the vampires 
that kidnapped his neighbours for leisurely meals. 
Together with his like-minded fiancée, Katarina Brunn, 
they tried to rally the people to fight back and strengthen 
their defenses. But with Avacyn’s disappearance and the 
protective wards surrounding the village failing, Siegfried 
became more and more desperate for answers to save his 
people.
Three years ago, Siegfried finally acquiesced to his 
cousin, Geralf’s, suggestion: he began to study necro-
alchemy, the foul art of bestowing life into stitched together 
corpses to create unholy abominations called skaabs. 
The alchemist perfected his craft in secret underneath 
his shop, waiting for the day that he could drive back the 
vampire threat with his stitched army.
When the Voldaren vampires came, murdered the 
mayor Ralph and kidnapped Katarina, something inside 
Siegfried snapped. He vowed revenge not only upon 
the accursed vampires that killed his beloved, but also 
the cowardly villagers that stood idly as it all happened. Part 3: Night of the Dead
Art by Peter Mohrbacher

--- Page 26 ---
26The alchemist fled from his home and traveled north to 
the abandoned Mauer Estate, where he’s been working 
tirelessly to make his dreams of vengeance a reality.
To defeat his hated vampire foes, Siegfried needs bodies. 
Lots of them. To this end, the alchemist has teamed up 
with a young necromancer named Rinelda Smitt. Together, 
they’ve raised a zombie horde to ravage the countryside. 
Rinelda leads the horde, destroying all settlements in 
her way and sending the corpses of her victims back to 
Mauer Estate, where Siegfried uses them to construct 
abominations to challenge the Voldaren vampires. In his 
twisted mind, the alchemist believes this a fitting end for 
his fellow countrymen, as their cowardly betrayal in life 
will be redeemed when they serve him in death.
Refugees
Word quickly spreads in Shadowgrange that a large group 
of refugees have arrived from a neighbouring settlement. 
A group of cathars meets them at the village gate and 
escorts them to the marketplace, where priests from the 
chapel (including Flora) arrive to help treat the wounded. 
Cathars and curious villagers alike crowd around the 
refugees to find out what happened.
The refugees hail from Mordov, a settlement one day 
north of Shadowgrange. Yesterday, Mordov was attacked 
by an army of walking dead – these twenty-six refugees 
are the only ones that managed to escape. The refugees 
distanced themselves from the zombie horde with their 
three carriages and horses.
If the characters interview the survivors and voice any 
of the following statements or questions, the refugees 
respond as indicated:
• What happened? A fog rolled in from the farbog north 
of Mordov. It was thicker than usual and carried a stiff 
chill. Many in town knew it to be a bad omen. They 
were right. Next we heard the screams. The restless 
dead were upon us. The shambling remains of folk 
like you and me attacked the living, biting, tearing… 
Avacyn protect us!
• How’d you escape? Us few that survived were the 
lucky ones standing near the stables when the undead 
attacked. We took any horses still there, along with the 
carriages, and rounded up as many folk as we could. 
Then we made a blind ride out into the fog. Many of 
us didn’t make it…
• What attacked your village?  The walking dead. Corpses 
that should be in the ground, peaceful in the Blessed 
Sleep. They shambled towards us with pitiless eyes. 
All they wanted to do was tear us apart. Cared for nothing else.
• How many are there? It was impossible to tell when 
the attack happened. One moment a fog rolled in, 
the next they were everywhere. But we saw them 
again across the valley as we fled. Hundreds of them, 
definitely.
• Where did they come from? When we saw them, they 
already were all around us. But all the walking dead 
had dried mud up to their waists. You get muddy like 
that from walking through the farbog (swamp) north 
of Mordov, so I reckon that’s where they came from.
• Was it just zombies?  No. It was mostly undead 
villagers, but I caught a glimpse of two hulking 
monstrosities lumbering about. They were twice my 
height and had the strength of ten men – in fact, 
judging by the number of arms sticking out of the 
creatures, they very well could’ve been made of ten 
men! The abominations were smashing down doors 
and swatting away cathars like flies. But the worst 
thing I saw was a human walking amongst these 
brutes. A teenaged girl chanting and waving a symbol 
around – I don’t know what it was. She was laughing 
and prancing around as we were being slaughtered 
left and right. Laughing! It must’ve been one of those 
vile necromancers that command the dead. How 
could something so young be so wicked? 
• Did you see Siegfried? A man by that name came 
through our village a few months ago. He was in a 
foul mood and avoided small talk. He rested, stocked 
up on supplies, and then headed into the farbog to the 
north, despite us telling him it was a suicidie mission. 
Never heard anything of him since then.
Developments
The refugees have more dire news for the crowd around 
them: as they fled, the survivors saw brief glimpses of 
the horde beginning to move south, in the direction of 
Shadowgrange. At the rate they were moving, they’d reach 
this village in two days.
Panic ensues when this information is revealed. 
Stensians are stoic folk and dealing with horrors is a 
grim fact of life, but an entire horde of undead bent on 
their annihilation isn’t something they’ve ever had to 
face before. The cathars do their best to maintain order 
amongst the crowd.  
Once she hears about the impending attack, priestess 
Flora seeks out the adventurers. A meeting of the village 
leaders is to be called immediately and she asks for the 
characters to join them.
Chapter 3: Night of the Dead

Ill Tidings
With rumors of an undead horde approaching, the leaders 
of Shadowgrange call a council meeting to determine 
what should be done. As the most capable adventurers in 
town, the PCs are invited.
Priestess Flora summons the adventurers to thw town 
hall at the Visgaud Grounds, where Eckhardt Sheckt 
(proprieter of the Silver Rose Inn and retired cathar) and 
Captain Levi (leader of the village militia) are waiting.
You are all gathered in the town hall. Here with you are 
Eckhardt, the owner of Silver Rose inn; and Captain 
Levi, leader of Shadowgrange’s local cathars. Along with 
Priestess Flora, these people comprise the Town Council.
“Well, you all know why we’re here,” Flora says without 
preamble. “If what these refugees say is true, there’s a 
horde of undead rampaging through the countryside and they’ll be here in a matter of days. We must figure out 
what is to be done.”
There are two main options to discuss: defend the town 
or evacuate.
If they defend the town, Captain Levi has 40 cathars 
under his command and believes he can conscript an 
additional 100 townsfolk (hunters, farmers, tradesfolk) of 
varying combat prowess. Priestess Flora and her ten clergy 
members can provide divine support to the troops, and 
she can call up ten trained bowyers (the Moontouched 
Sisters and others) to fight as well.
If they evacuate, there are smaller settlements south of 
Shadowgrange within a day’s journey. The next biggest 
settlement is the rancher community called Lammas, two 
days away. Finally, the greatest military strength nearby is 
Silbern, a small community built around Silbern Tower. 
This tower is a lodging and base of operations for a group 
of cathars called the Silbern Guard, about a hundred

28trained fighters. Silbern is three days away to the east.
These are the two options that the council members will 
argue for, but the characters can come up with different 
ideas as well.
This is a chance for the players to throw in their own 
advice about how Shadowgrange should meet the threat. 
The council members have their own opinions.
Eckhardt:  Grim. A seasoned ex-cathar himself, Eckhardt 
has his doubts that the village walls can hold, and once 
they’re breached, the zombies would easily overrun the 
village. He advocates evacuation. “We don’t have enough 
cathars to hold off a zombie horde. We need to start 
evacuating the village and get the people south.”
Levi:  Also grim, but more optimistic. Levi points out 
that the roads south are narrow and dangerous. Trying 
to protect a thousand evacuating villagers would be next 
to impossible and there will bound to be casualties. He 
advocates defending the village. “The gates and walls 
will hold. If the undead cannot breach out defense, their 
superior numbers will mean nothing.”
Flora:  Stubborn and fatalistic. Flora sees abandoning 
the village as an ultimate failure. Countless generations 
are buried in the village crypt, resting eternally in The 
Blessed Sleep, and they cannot be forsaken. She advocates 
fighting to the bitter end if need be. “Our destiny is in 
Avacyn’s hands. She would not want us to abandon our 
ancestors.”
This is an encounter best resolved through roleplaying. 
Let the characters argue their case for whichever response 
they favor. If you feel they have argued persuasively, their 
position should carry the day.
Since the characters are probably arguing for a position 
favored by at least one of the council members, all they 
really need to do is convince the ones that disagree.
Developments
Once the council has settled on a decision, they quickly 
go about relaying orders. If the town is to be defended, 
skip down to “Defending Shadowgrange.” For details to 
evacuate, go to “Evacuation.”
Hours after the council meeting begins, the scouting 
group led by Silvia confirms that the zombie horde is 
indeed traveling towards Shadowgrange from the north. It 
is comprised of about four hundred zombies, three large 
stitched abominations, two dozen skeletons, and a female 
human that seems to be herding them. At their pace, the 
horde should arrive in two days.Awarding Experience Points
Divide 600 XP equally among the characters if the 
party succeeds in persuading the council to adopt their 
preferred course of action.
Attacking the Horde
Bringing the fight to the undead horde would be suicidal. In 
total, the horde is comprised of 400 zombies, 20 skeletons, 
3 skaab goliaths, and a necromancer. The adventurers 
and any of the townsfolk they’d bring with them would 
be greatly outnumbered. The only chance of victory in 
battle is to fight them atop Shadowgrange’s walls, where 
the defenders can utilize their ranged advantage while the 
horde is kept at bay.
The characters can employ hit-and-run tactics while 
the horde travels, however. Executed properly, it can 
wittle away their numbers before the real engagement at 
Shadowgrange. But make sure to emphasize the sheer 
magnitude of undead moving together, so the characters 
are well aware that attacking head-on would be incredibly 
foolish and lethal.
Adventurers leaving immediately northward can easily 
find the advancing horde within a day’s journey (the horde 
moves slowly as a group, moving at half the speed of 
traveling adventurers). Riding horses will shave off a few 
more hours of travel time. 
The horde moves as a loosely organized group herded 
in the right direction by Rinelda Smitt, a necromancer that 
stays in the center of the group. Five large wooden wagons 
are pulled along with the horde by zombies, which are 
used to collect corpses to send back to Mauer Estate. 
This horde isn’t so much an “army” as an abnormally 
large group of undead wandering in the same direction. 
They do not have formations or follow complex tactics. 
Any undead that spots the adventurers will instinctively 
attack. If they lose sight of the adventurers, or if they stray 
too far from the herd, they head back.
 Attacking outlying zombies causes some of the 
closest undead to take notice. If they spot the assailants, 
the zombies shamble forward to attack. This triggers a 
domino effect as more and more undead notice what’s 
going on and join the battle. 
The horde comes in waves, with the first wave 
representing outlier zombies furthest from the horde’s 
center and moves to involve higher concentrations of 
undead more central to the horde until you get to the fifth 
wave, the center of the horde where Rinelda resides. The 
necromancer is nearly impossible to spot in the crowd. 
When a wave joins the battle, the following wave joins 
1d6+2 rounds after.

command and still march in the direction of Shadowgrange, 
but fifty zombies wander the wrong way and are deducted

Rinelda Smitt insane. The teen lost her parents at a very 
young age and has survived in the wilderness purely off 
her talents in necromancy. She is devoid of empathy for 
her victims, seeing humans as useful only as resources 
to raid for food, clothing, shelter, and their corpses for 
undead. The only thing she understands and respects is 
power. If her life is on the line, she’ll explain her partnership 
with Siegfried, and how she’s culling the land to bring him 
corpses for his experiments (see “The Horde’s Purpose”). 
Rinelda respects Siegfried’s talents and hopes to learn 
everything she can as his apprentice before inevitably 
murdering him and taking over his residence.
Rinelda carries basic necessities (clothing, food) along 
with a ghoulcaller’s bell  (APPENDIX A) ( PICTURE ), and a 
large pouch containing 90 ep and 70 gp. On her person is 
a note written by Siegfried, reminding the teen to collect 
everything she can find in his shop’s basement, from 
papers to alchemical supplies.
Defending Shadowgrange
If the characters choose to defend the town, they can 
spend the time before the horde arrives by preparing the 
town’s defenses. Let the characters lead the discussion on 
what to do during this time. The council members respect 
the opinions of capable adventurers, especially when it 
comes to battle, and they’ll follow the party’s initiative for 
planning.
Adventurers are a delightfully creative and unpredictable 
bunch and you should encourage their plans if reasonable. 
Reward good planning, whatever it may be. In addition 
to the character’s ideas, the council members also voice 
opinions on what to do. These preparation quests will yield 
benefits in the battle to come (see “Running the Siege”):
• Warding the Walls.  Priestess Flora thinks she 
can re-ignite the holy wards that used to protect 
Shadowgrange’s walls, but she’ll need help doing 
so. Any character with proficiency in Intelligence 
(Religion) can choose to aid her in performing the 
holy rituals to infuse the walls with holy energy. If at 
least one character does, Flora and that character can 
re-arm the wards by spending eight hours devoted to 
carrying out the ritual. Each additional character aiding 
in the ritual reduces the time required by four hours.  
On success:  The walls radiate a faint divine magic. 
Lesser undead, such as zombies and skeletons, 
are repelled from getting too close, and the skaab 
goliaths in “Assault on the Gate” scenario  take longer

30to destroy the gate.
• Finding Runners.  Captain Levi suggests finding 
suitable messengers amongst the conscripted 
townsfolk to relay information between the 
characters and council members. This way they 
can better coordinate their defences during the 
battle. Any character can approach a townsperson 
to be a runner. Convincing a person to take the job 
requires a Charisma (Diplomacy) check DC 10.  
On success:  The characters have messengers to keep 
them informed of how the battle progresses. In the 
“Defending the Breach” scenario, they characters can 
arrive earlier, saving more defenders and are rewarded 
with an additional influence dice.
• Boosting Morale.  Eckhardt Sheck knows that the 
conscripted townsfolk are terrified of the approaching 
horde. These people are not fighters; they are farmers, 
shepherds, and tradesmen. They need a confidence 
boost to have them perform well in battle. Any character 
can try to raise the hopes of the conscripted townsfolk. 
They can do so in numerous ways, from a rousing 
speech, playing up the strengths of the adventurers, 
showing the commoners how to properly wield their 
weapons, squashing any talks of hopelessness, 
or any other reasonable idea the characters come 
up with. An appropriate skill check DC 15 inspires 
confidence in the conscripts witnessing this.  
On success:  Defenders that witness the character’s 
actions are inspired, fighting more effectively in the 
siege, dealing more damage to the skaab goliaths in 
the “Assault on the Gate” scenario.
• More Conscripts.  Captain Levi points out that the 
undead horde still greatly outnumber the defenders. 
To help increase the chances of survival, a weapon 
should be put into the hands of any person that can 
hold it. Levi suggests more aggressively conscripting 
any person able to wield a weapon, including children 
and the elderly. It will take convincing on the part of the 
characters to make this happen, however, as parents 
will be reluctant to send their young ones to battle. 
As in the “Boosting Morale” quest, the characters can 
be creative with their ways and pass an appropriate 
skill DC to conscript the children and elderly.  
On success:  The characters can conscript up to 50 
additional young and elderly commoners. These 
commoners help deal additional damage to the skaab 
goliaths in the “Assault on the Gate” scenario.
Add any other quests that you feel are appropriate to the 
situation.
As the characters go about preparing, so do the rest 
of the townsfolk. Shadowgrange’s cathars calls upon 
all able-bodied citizens to take up arms against the oncoming attack. These conscripted commoners gather 
in the town square bringing whatever weapons they have, 
from hunting bows to pitchforks, where they await orders.
The rest of the townsfolk rush to evacuate precious 
belongings from their outlying homes and farms to the 
safety of Shadowgrange’s walls. Noncombatants are 
squeezed into the town chapel, which is reinforced with 
makeshift barricades.
Once the civilians are accounted for, the cathars and 
conscripted soldiers will work day and night to reinforce 
the gate and build makeshift barricades along the main 
path leading to the market square.
Free Pots.  The clergy members seek out the adventurers. 
They are well aware that the characters’ prowess will play 
a critical factor in defending the town, so they give them 
four healing potions  for the fight.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 900 XP equally among the characters if the party 
aids the town in preparing defenses.
Evacuation?
This adventure assumes most parties will decide to stand 
their ground and defend Shadowgrange. However, they 
can choose to flee from the oncoming undead horde. Or 
perhaps they evacuate the town, lure the undead inside, 
and then set the place on fire, destroying both the town 
but also the horde if done correctly. There is no “wrong” 
way to attack this problem. 
Should the characters choose to flee or evacuate, there 
are a few settlements not far from Shadowgrange that 
they can travel to. None have the defensible stone walls of 
Shadowgrange, but all are encircled by a moat and some 
sort of physical barrier, such as wooden palisades or at 
the very least somewhat defensible trenches. The closest 
settlement is a day away.
There are two notable settlements fairly close to 
Shadowgrange. The first is Lammas, a rancher community 
stable village two days away. The second is Silbern, a

Chapter 3: Night of the Dead

31
small community built around Silbern Tower, a lodging 
and base of operations for a local group of cathars called 
the Silbern Guard. Three days away, this community has 
the largest concentration of cathars in Stensia, with a little 
over a hundred trained fighters ready to take up arms.
It’s dangerous to travel through Stensia, as the 
adventurers probably know already. You may wish to run 
some of the random encounters from Part 1 while the 
characters travel to other settlements. Lesser undead, 
fiends, beasts, and bandits roam preying on travelers.
The zombie horde is on a rampage through the entire 
countryside. Their sole purpose is to slay the living and 
return the corpses back to Siegfried in Mauer Estate. If 
the characters retreat from Shadowgrange, the horde 
continues moving south, slaughtering all communities 
along the way. Any settlement in the outland valleys of 
Stensia will be attacked eventually. Maybe the adventurers 
team up with the Silbern Guard and take on the horde at 
a different location. Roll with the player’s ideas and it will 
all work out in the end.
Running the SiegeAn undead army marches on Shadowgrange and its 
defenders are prepared to meet them in battle. Keeping 
track of hundreds of combatants, including their individual 
stats and rolls, would be impossible. Instead, it’s 
recommended to run the siege by keeping the adventures 
and their personal action as the focus like any other battle, 
with the greater battle around them being told mostly 
through story rather than dice rolls.
With this method, the battle rages on as a backdrop: 
the focus is on the fight between the characters and their 
enemies. The larger conflict takes place “offstage,” and 
is only relevant to the extent that it helps or hinders the 
characters.
The adventurers will act as Shadowgrange’s elite 
defense unit in the battle, sent to deal with the toughest, 
most dangerous missions. The result of these missions 
will determine the ultimate fate of Shadowgrange itself.  
Don’t bother tracking the hit points of the various 
combatants, except the ones the adventurers are actively 
fighting. Just describe the carnage as the defenders 
and horde battle it out, while the characters take on the 
toughest part of the enemy forces. A short sentence or

32two at the end of a round or the end of a battle is great 
to maintain the players’ awareness of the ongoing battle 
around them and keeps them immersed.
Thinning the Numbers
If the PCs destroyed some of the advancing horde in 
“Attacking the Horde” or otherwise, deduct the destroyed 
creatures from the horde’s total numbers here. If the 
adventurers destroyed any of the three skaab goliaths, 
some of the following encounters need to be changed:
• If one goliath was destroyed prior to the siege, then 
there is no goliath present at the “Defending the 
Breach” battle, making it much easier. 
• Any additional skaab goliaths destroyed prior to the 
siege (up to three) are subtracted from the “Assault 
on the Gate” battle, which gives a huge advantage to 
hold the gate.
Horde Tactics
The undead horde’s attack comes during the dead of 
night, where they can take advantage of their darkvision. 
Shadowgrange’s defenders have at least the light of the 
stars and the moon to see by, along with torches lining 
their walls to illuminate anyone beside their defenses. The 
attack is led by Rinelda Smitt, a necromancer herding the 
horde towards Shadowgrange.
The horde’s attack is organized into stages, detailed 
below. The actions of the characters can disrupt these 
stages; they are presented here as they would play out if 
the characters weren’t on hand to aid in Shadowgrange’s 
defense. 
Stage 1:  The undead horde advances on Shadowgrange. 
The majority of zombies, led by two skaabs, shambles 
forward to break down the gate, while skeleton archers 
fire at any defenders they see.
Stage 2:  A secondary force of undead attacks led by one 
skaab breaches the wall, away from the main fighting at 
the gate.
Stage 3:  Swarms of undead pour through gaps in the 
city defenses created by the skaabs and begin wreaking 
havoc.
Stage 4:  The undead horde fully enters Shadowgrange, 
routing the defenders to the chapel.
Stage 5:  Rinelda Smitt personally leads an assault on 
the chapel, looking to finish off the remaining defenders.
Assault on the Gate
The horde are traversing the valley and approaching Shadowgrange. It’s night, and none of the defenders 
(except maybe an adventurer) has darkvision to see. 
Unless the adventurers are attacking, or have provided 
the other defenders a way to see the approaching horde, 
Captain Levi orders his crossbowmen and archers to hold 
fire until they can get a clear shot.
If the adventurers ride out to attack the approaching 
horde, use the stats given in “Attacking the Horde” section 
earlier.
When the horde ( PICTURE ) arrives at the walls, read or 
paraphrase:
They arrive in the dead of night: hundreds of shambling 
humanoids. In the moonlight, their figures silhouettes 
can be seen, along with glimpses of their rotted faces. 
As they near the walls, torches illuminate their hideous 
appearances. The zombies move towards Shadowgrange 
with a strange urgency; splashing and flailing in the 
moat’s waters, scrambling over each other to reach the 
walls, lashing at the gate, tearing, ripping, growling.
Lumbering forward, towering over the other zombies, 
are two stitched abominations. Six powerful arms and 
three heads are attached to each mass of muscle. These 
creatures stride easily through the moat’s waters and 
move towards Shadowgrange’s gates, where they start 
start pummeling it with armor-plated fists, shaking the 
barricade with each blow. Captain Levi begins to yell and 
wave a torch to get attention. “Bowmen! Take out those 
beasts! Now!”
2 skaab goliaths  (APPENDIX B) ( PICTURE ) begin leading 
the attack on the gate. They smash the gate each round, 
unless something prevents them from doing so. The gate 
can take 10 hits (or 5 rounds of both hitting) total from 
the skaabs before being breached. Captain Levi is aware 
of the danger they pose and barks out orders to take them 
down. If the adventurers completed the quest “Warding 
the Walls,” the gate instead can take 12 hits total before 
being breached.
The defenders on the walls begin raining down crossbow 
bolts and arrows upon the goliaths, dealing 22 damage per 
round divided between the two goliaths unless specifically 
told to aim at one. If the adventurers completed the quest 
“Boosting Morale” or “More Conscripts,” the damage per 
round is increased by 4 per quest completed.
To make matters worse, as the order is given to bring 
down the goliaths, screams can be heard from atop the 
walls. 20 skeleton archers  (MM 272) pepper the bowmen 
atop the walls, using their darkvision to fire from 40 feet 
away.  The constant barrage hampers the defender’s ability 
to take down the goliaths.
For every five skeletons the adventurers take out, the 
defending bowmen can fire more freely, increase their 
Chapter 3: Night of the Dead

--- Page 33 ---
33
damage on the goliaths by +2 each round.
Developments
If the skaab goliaths are taken out before the gate is 
breached by them, then the gate holds. Regular zombies 
stumble over the fallen goliaths to claw at the gate, but 
their assault is far weaker than the skaab’s.
If the gate is breached, all is not lost. Eckhardt and his 
soldiers, a mix of cathars and conscripts, stand ready to 
meet the surge of undead that rush through the broken 
gate. Their goal is to drive the undead back long enough 
to repair the broken gate.
Regardless of the outcome, a messenger runs over 
to the adventurers shortly after either the gate is saved/
breached. The bloodied soldier comes bearing grim news: 
one of the far side walls have been breached. The undead 
are breaking through, and her squadron of soldiers have 
been taking heavy losses trying to hold their position. 
Captain Levi will ask the adventurers to reinforce the 
breach.
If the adventurers completed the quest “Finding 
Runners,” the messenger is one of the people the characters enlisted as a runner, and they’re given an earlier 
warning that a wall is soon to be breached.
Defending the Breach
The undead have breached one of the walls and have 
begun pouring in. Without the adventurers intervening at 
the breach, that position will almost assuredly be overrun. 
If the gate has been breached and the adventurers decide 
to defend it instead, you can configure the following 
encounter to work for that too.
Once the adventurers arrive at the breach, read or 
paraphrase:
The warm glow of fire can be seen over the rooftops ahead 
of you, where the sounds of fighting can be heard. As you 
turn the corner, you see two wooden cabins aflame next 
to the wall, illuminating the scene in front of you. Fighting 
amidst the bright glow in a tight formation are the cathars, 
clashing with dozens of undead humanoids. More still

34pour into the street from a breach in the wall 10 feet wide, 
clambering over the stone debris and eagerly rushing to 
the living defenders. “By Avacyn’s Might, we hold!” shouts 
a cathar, even as the soldiers are slowly pushed back.
If the adventurers leave for the breach quickly, then they 
find a heated battle between the invading undead and the 
village defenders. A dozen soldiers fight here against ever-
increasing numbers of zombies. These eleven cathars 
statted as guards  (MM 347), along with a single clergy 
member (treat her as a priest [MM 348] without Divine 
Eminence, no 2nd or 3rd level spells, and only 10 HP). 
If the adventurers took their time getting here, or didn’t 
complete the “Finding Runners” quest, five of these 
cathars are dead when they arrive. 
The cathars’ goal is to push the undead out long enough 
to barricade the breach, but they don’t have the numbers 
to do so. Only with the adventurer’s help in the fight can 
they hope to accomplish their task.
Optional: Influence Dice
In this battle, the adventurers are given their own targets 
to eliminate while the cathars fight their own battles with 
the undead in the background. To help illustrate the fight, 
you may consider using this optional Influence Dice 
mechanic, where the combatants in the backdrop can still 
influence the party’s battle while still being rolls-light.
Represent the background defender’s influence in the 
fight with two Ally Dice (d6’s), or only one dice if five 
cathars are already dead. Represent the background 
undead’s influence with three Enemy Dice. 
At the end of each round, roll the dice for each side. 
For every 6 in the result, that side does something that 
affect’s the party’s fight. If the 6 is a result of the Ally Dice 
roll, it’s a help; if it’s a result of the Enemy Dice roll, it’s a 
hindrance.
For every result of 5, that side does something that affects 
the party’s fight, but at a negative cost to themeselves.Possible effects include:

Waves of Undead
In order to hold the line and drive the undead back, the 
characters must defeat several waves of increasingly 
dangerous attackers while the cathars fight their own 
undead foes in the background. Allow each wave’s 
resulting combat to play out, then let the next wave 
arrive one or two rounds after. This gives the characters 
a small window to ready themselves for the next fight. 
Alternatively, if the characters are finding combat too easy, 
you can have subsequent waves arrive faster.
First Wave
3 zombies  (MM 316) rush forward to attack the characters 
closest to them, along with 3 skeletons  (MM 272) that

Enemy Dice after the party defeats the first wave.

Necromancer Confrontation
A messenger arrives from Captain Levi, requiring the 
party’s immediate assistance: a necromancer has arrived 
and is cutting through his troops. The adventurers are 
needed to stop her onslaught.
When the characters arrive, dozens of defenders and 
zombies are locked in battle. Rinelda Smitt stands out 
amongst the crowd, squaring off with Captain Levi. The 
cathar commander, statted as a thug  (MM 350; Lawful 
Good), is barely hanging in there -- he’s down to 10 hit 
points and suffering from 1 level of exhaustion. Rinelda is 
toying with him using her spiritual weapon (in the form of 
a spectral dagger) to stab at him.

chains. The shrieking emits from large gaping mouths all 
over its body that glow an intense bright blue.
A shriekgeist (PICTURE ), statted as a specter  (MM 279), 
has been lured to the ensuing carnage like a moth to a 
flame. It attacks the adventurers with incomprehensible 
hatred.
 2 zombies  and 2 skeletons  also join the battle using the 
same tactics as above.
If you are using Influence Dice, remove one of the 
Enemy Dice after the party defeats the second wave.
Third Wave
A low, booming roar is heard from the wall, followed 
by shouts of surprise and despair as a hulking stitched 
abomination heaves itself through the breach. It swings 
morningstar down at the nearest cathar, slamming the 
poor human deep into the earth with a sickening crunch 
and a spatter of blood. More zombies squeeze through as 
the skaab moves forward. 
2 zombies , 1 skeleton , and 1 skaab goliath  (APPENDIX B) 
(PICTURE ). Same tactics as above.
Developments
If the adventurers defeat all three waves, the cathars 
destroy the remaining undead and have enough time to 
seal up the breach with a makeshift barricade of wood and 
stone debris. It’s not very strong, but it’s enough to deter 
the undead from entering through here.
If the adventurers retreat from the battle instead, then 
the position is quickly overrun by undead. While many 
more zombies enter through the breach, all is not lost, 
since the horde as a whole isn’t organized enough to take 
full advantage of this entrance and send more numbers 
through. Any surviving cathars retreat back to the gate to 
inform Captain Levi of the situation, which he responds 
to by leading a group of his best soldiers to launch a 
counterattack and reclaim the area.
Results
The location of the next encounter, “Necromancer 
Confrontation,” depends on the adventurer’s previous 
actions: 
• If both the gate and the breach were successfully 
defended, a frustrated Rinelda scales the wall and 
makes a last-ditch attempt to defeat the defenders 
Chapter 3: Night of the Dead

--- Page 36 ---
36corpses for his experiments (see “The Horde’s Purpose”). 
Rinelda respects Siegfried’s talents and hopes to learn 
everything she can as his apprentice before inevitably 
murdering him and taking over his residence.
Rinelda carries basic necessities (clothing, food) along 
with a ghoulcaller’s bell  (APPENDIX A) ( PICTURE ), and a 
large pouch containing 5 ep and 92 gp. On her person is 
a note written by Siegfried, reminding the teen to collect 
everything she can find in his shop’s basement, from 
papers to alchemical supplies.
Victory!
With Rinelda defeated, the undead briefly falter, looking 
dazed. A loud cheer erupts from nearby defenders as they 
see the adventurer’s victory. The people fight fiercer with 
renewed resolve, pushing back the horde and eventually 
vanquishing them. It takes another two hours to clean up 
any undead roaming within the town’s walls. 
How well the defenders fared depends on the 
adventurer’s accomplishments. If both the gate and wall 
breach held, then casualties and property damage are 
shockingly few. The more failed objectives, the worse the 
death toll and damage to Shadowgrange. 
The townsfolk spend the next day carrying out post-
battle activities: clergy members tend to the wounded, 
cathars dismantle barricades, tradesfolk begin repairing 
damages, and other people help with gathering the dead 
to be buried later.
A group of cathars rides out to cleanse the surrounding 
valley of any pockets of undead still roaming the land. The 
few scattered zombies are easily disposed of. When the 
cathars return, they bring news that some of the zombies 
were guarding large wooden wagons, some empty and 
others holding corpses.
Once all the immediate concerns are taken care of, 
Priestess Flora invites the characters to a great victory 
celebration. The celebration begins with a rousing speech 
by Flora in front of the chapel, where she publicly thanks the 
characters eachby name. Take the time to play this scene out, and make sure to call out a couple of key actions of 
bravery or even luck that each character displayed during 
the battle. Without the party’s help, hundreds of people 
would now be dead and Shadowgrange would have been 
lost. 
At the end of the speech, Flora motions to bring forth a 
large chest filled with coins to be given to the adventurers 
as thanks. Assuming the characters succeeded on each 
objective, the chest contains 2,100 cp, 1,050 sp, and 260 
gp. Reduce the amount of coins depending on how many 
objectives were failed, as the town will need more money 
to repair damages incurred in the battle.
After the chest is presented and the crowd finishes 
cheering for the adventurers, Eckhardt approaches 
them and asks for a word in private. When they move 
somewhere more quiet, the innkeeper solemnly gifts the 
party two of the best items from the cathars’ armory. If 
Captain Levi fell in battle, these are his personal items, 
and Eckhardt explains that the deceased cathar would 
be honored if his arms continued to slay the wicked. The 
gifts are a +1 weapon  and +1 armor/shield . Customize 
the weapon and armor to your party: for example, if a 
Dexterity-focused rogue still needs a weapon and prefers 
using a rapier, perhaps the weapon is a +1 rapier called 
Kindness; its handguard decorated in silver filigree in the 
shape of a thousand feathers; it glows pale blue in the 
presence of fiends.
Defeat!
If the characters failed to defeat Rinelda but succeeded 
in either holding the gate or the wall breach, then the 
necromancer forces the defenders to retreat to the chapel 
while the horde overruns the rest of Shadowgrange. Here 
the adventurers have enough time for a short rest before 
Rinelda gathers her forces for a final assault. This is the 
final chance to stop the undead and save the town.
If the adventurers fail to stop Rinelda at the chapel, then 
the defenders are broken. Priestess Flora and the rest of 
the surviving council members rallies what’s left of the 
townsfolk for one desperate push, fighting their way out 
of Shadowgrange. They take heavy losses doing so, but 
eventually the survivors make it out alive. The undead 
horde is too disorganized to give chase.
Priestess Flora contacts the characters and thanks 
them for their aid, but she is unable to hide the bitterness 
and despair in her voice. There is no ceremony, and this 
meeting is rushed. Shadowgrange is lost, and its people 
flee south to neighboring communities as refugees. 
Word of the horde’s rampage travels to Silbern (see 
“Evacuation”) and perhaps the cathars there mobilize 
enough troops to stop the horde. Or maybe the vampire 
families step in, destroying the undead to protect their

human livestock.
Developments
After the adventurers have a bit of time to recover from the 
battle, Priestess Flora contacts them. She explains that her 
people have never encountered an undead horde like the 
one they faced. Flora knows that the stitched horrors, the 
skaabs, are the foul work of necro-alchemists. If the army 
was built by such people, it may be that the horde they 
encountered is but a precursor to more attacks to come. 
For the sake of all Stensia, Flora begs the adventurers to 
find the source of these undead and stop it once and for 
all. The refugees from Mordov said that the horde came 
from the north, and the most notable location north of 
there is Mauer Estate, a long-abandoned mansion that 
has housed many residents over the centuries, from 
ancient royalty to mad wizards. 
If the adventurers mention Siegfried, either their 
findings in his alchemy shop or the note on Rinelda Smitt, 
then Priestess Flora agrees that he could be the source. 
Siegfried was last seen heading in the direction of Mauer 
Estate, and if they have evidence that he turned to necro-
alchemy, then it seems like he would be the first one the 
adventurers should confront.

Chapter 3: Night of the Dead

--- Page 38 ---
38In this part of the adventure, the characters travel to 
Mauer Estate, located at the northern edge of Stensia’s 
outer valley. To do so, they will need to journey through a 
large bog that divides the southern part of the valley from 
its northern tip.
Depending on which NPCs the characters met and 
which quests or clues they picked up, some or all the 
following information might be known to them:
• Priestess Flora wants the characters to travel to Mauer 
Estate and uncover the source of the undead.
• Rinelda Smit can confirm that Siegfried is the creator 
of the undead armies and is working at Mauer Estate.
• Silvia Wintsch wants the characters to bring her any 
sanguine lotus they find in the bog.
• Siegfried holds the missing piece of the Strionic 
Resonator, which some of the characters may have 
been tasked to retrieve for the Church of Avacyn.Farbog Superstitions
If the characters agree to Priestess Flora’s request to check 
out Mauer Estate, she thanks them for their courage and 
commitment to righteousness. Flora warns them to be 
careful while traversing the farbog (Innistrad’s fancy term 
for bog/swamp) that the adventurers must pass through 
to reach the estate. In particular, she warns them about 
hellhounds: “I know you’re strong and capable adventurers, 
but trust me, if you come across a hellhound… run.” This 
warning is particularly important to give the characters, as 
it sets up the “Hounds of Baskerville” encounter.
Once the characters accept Flora’s mission, word 
spreads around town of the character’s impending 
journey through the farbog (Flora tells her clergymen, 
they tell friends and relatives, and it spreads). Helpful, 
but superstitious townsfolk approach the party members 
and offer advice on how to stay safe. The suggestions 
range from reasonably insightful to ignorance. Some 
suggestions include:
• Never stare into a hellhound’s eyes or it will devour 
your soul.
• Eat wormwood and other bitter herbs; it will make

39
you less palatable to things that roam the night (the 
townsfolk that suggests it offers the character some of 
the aforementioned herb).
• Travel by day and rest at roadside shrines by night.
• If you hear howling at midnight, someone close to you 
will die.
• Be quiet while traversing the ancient grafs (Innistrad’s 
fancy term for “crypt”) inside the farbog, lest you wake 
the dead.
• Pale ghosts are the friendly kind, except when they’re 
not.
• Travel by night and rest at roadside shrines by day.
• If a black cat crosses the road in front of you, it’s a 
sign of bad luck. 
If the characters ask about the farbog itself, they can find 
out from various townsfolk that it’s a treacherous swamp 
that people avoid if possible. One prominent rumor is 
that the farbog used to be a beautiful forest with one of 
the most influential settlements in all of Innistrad, but an 
evil tainted the forest, turning it into the farbog it is now.
The bog has a well-known reputation for being the 
residence of hellhounds, though it’s also said that few 
folk are lucky enough to see one and live to tell the tale. 
Others mention that ancient grafs dissolve into the muck, 
causing the restless dead to stir as geists (spirits) and 
ghouls.
Traveling to the Swamp
It takes one day of traveling north through the outer valley 
to reach the farbog. A few abandoned communities can 
be found in between Shadowgrange and the bog; the 
undead horde passed through these settlements on their 
way to Shadowgrange, killing most of the inhabitants 
and sending their corpses back to Mauer Estate. None 
of these communities are remarkable: each is comprised 
of outlying farms and cabins huddled together, with a 
modest chapel for prayer. If you wish, you can place one 
of these villages in the path of the characters, offering 
the opportunity to explore the wreckage. Perhaps a few 
people managed to survive the undead’s rampage and 
still live here. Or maybe some undead still linger in the 
area, hungering for the living.
The zombie horde left Mauer Estate and trekked south, 
through the farbog, through the small villages, all the 
way to Shadowgrange. Their footprints are easy to spot 
and follow back to the estate. In addition to footprints, 
heavy wagon wheels can be followed. These wagons were 
carried by the horde and filled with corpses. Once filled, 
the wagon would be hauled back to Mauer Estate, where 
Siegfried would use them in his experiements. The Farbog
Once the adventurers enter the farbog, read or paraphrase:
The grassy plains of the valley dampens into inky black 
muck as you enter the farbog. Barren pine trees sink into 
the mud at odd angles, creating a tangle of dead trunks. A 
dreary grey mist envelopes the area.
The farbog is muddy, damp, and stinks of rotting 
vegetation. A mist surrounds the area; it doesn’t impede 
nearby vision, but anything beyond 300 feet disappears 
behind the grey curtain.
The ground is a mix of muddy earth and shallow bog. 
Traveling through here is considered difficult terrain (see 
the rulebook for more information). The zombie horde 
mostly stuck to the main road that passes through the 
swamp; adventurers following the main road or zombie 
horde can easily track hundreds of shambling footprints 
and heavy wagon wheels dragged through the muck.
Following the main road, which runs north to south, is 
the easiest way to journey through the swamp towards 
Mauer Estate.
Swamp Encounters
Traveling through the swamp takes one day. Along the 
journey through the farbog, the characters will partake in 
three of the following events below (though feel free to 
run as many events as you wish!).
Choose three of the events, marking when they occur 
(day/night). Alternatively, roll a D6 and consult the Swamp 
Encounters table to determine what the party meets, 
rerolling any 6 or duplicate results.
The difficulty of combat encounters and their subsequent 
XP awards assume a party of four level 4’s. If this is not 
the case in your game, or if you wish to make the combat 
easier or harder, you may tweak the combat encounters to 
your desired difficulty with Kobold Fight Club  or similar 
builders.

40previously warned about hellhounds in the swamp (See 
“Farbog Superstitions”).
As the characters journey through the swamp, they 
pass by the sunken remains of a long-forgotten village 
called Baskerville. What little remains of the crumbling 
and sunken village structures is barely recognizable in 
the overgrowth and muck. The skeletal remains of many 
of the villagers can be found littered around the area. A 
Wisdom (Medicine) DC 12 reveals none of them died 
from physical violence.  A Wisdom (Insight) DC 15 check 
indicates that the people appear to have all died in a state 
of absolute terror. 
The area filled with gloomgas mushrooms. These 
mushrooms release spores with hallucinogenic properties 
as the characters pass through. The spores fill the air and 
mixes invisibily with the surrounding fog.
The gloomgas mushrooms grow at the base of the 
surrounding pine trees, blending perfectly with the bark.
The spore clouds are released with a low rumbling sound that echoes throughout the area and is almost impossible 
to pinpoint its origins. Characters can spot one of these 
mushrooms with a DC 25 Perception check. A Nature DC 
20 can identify a spotted gloomgas mushroom.
Every round that a character is exposed to the spores, 
they must make a DC 15 Constitution check or be poisoned 
by the spore’s hallucinogenic properties. Characters that 
don’t breathe or are immune to poison are unaffected. 
Since the characters traveling through this part of the 
swamp are likely exposed to the spores for minutes or 
longer, it can be assumed that anyone not immune is 
eventually poisoned.
A poisoned character gradually begins to hallucinate. 
Read or paraphrase for them:
The fog grows cloyingly thick and surrounds you utterly. 
The pine trees seem taller here, leaning over you as if to 
snatch you with gnarled, claw-like branches. The muck 
you trek through sucks down your foot more with each

step you take, making it harder to move. The world is 
closing in on you.
Then you hear it: a low rumbling growl that emanates all 
around you. The growling gets louder; its tone is of sheer 
malice.
The growling sound is a perversion caused by the 
hallucination: it is actually the rumbling sound of the 
gloomgas mushrooms, but when heard by someone 
hallucinating from the spores, it sounds like a monstrous 
hound growling. This is the origin of the hellhound rumor. 
Give the poisoned characters a moment to react to the 
sound. Afterwards, read or paraphrase for them:
You spot them out of the corner of your vision: twin fiery 
red orbs burning through the cloak of fog. They move 
closer, and you see the rest of the figure emerge – a 
monstrous hound, as tall as a human, stepping forward 
on thick, muscular legs. As it growls, the beast exhales 
embers from its open maw filled with razor-sharp teeth 
and revealing a hot glow emanating from its throat.
You hear more growling from behind. Turning around, 
you see a second fiendish hound approaching from the 
opposite direction. Suddenly, the two beasts rush toward 
you in a full sprint, their eyes blazing with unbridled 
hatred.
These 2 hellhounds  (MM 182) are actually hallucinations 
caused by the gloomgas mushroom’s spores. Only 
characters hallucinating from the spores can see, hear, 
or be affected by them. The hounds circle around and 
strike at the weakest looking character, using their pack 
tactics to eliminate the target quickly before moving to 
the next. They use their Fire Breath if they can hit two or 
more characters with it. All damage dealt by the hounds 
to hallucinating characters looks like physical wounds, 
but in fact the characters are unknowingly taking psychic 
damage instead.
There are a few ways for a poisoned character to recognize 
the illusion. When a character is damaged for the first time 
by a hellhound, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving 
throw. On a success, they notice something “off” about 
the hellhound – its features are hazy and blurred, it leaves 
no footprints, there’s no weight to its attacks, etc. After 
this success, they can spend an action to concentrate on 
the hound, making a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On this 
success, the character shakes off the hallucination and the 
hellhounds disappear for them.
Alternatively, a character not hallucinating can help a 
poisoned ally shake off its effects by convincing the person 
that no hell hounds exist. They can stand in the same spot 
as where the “hellhound” stands, or try to explain that 
they are hallucinating, or anything else they can come up with. Doing so takes an action. When this is done, the ally 
can immediately make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 1,400 XP equally among the characters if the 
party defeats the hell hounds and/or shake off the 
hallucination.
Whispers of Hope and Doom
As you journey through the bog, you hear a shrill scream 
emanating from all around you. A dark red mist emerges 
from the ground all around you, mixing with the pervasive 
fog, thickening like a blood clot. The red mist envelopes 
the area, so thick that you can barely see your hand in 
front of you. Your entire body is quickly covered by a thin 
layer of this bloody substance, and the air smells of fire 
and brimstone.
The adventurers walk through a part of the farbog that is 
home to a colony of hellscream fungi that thrive on the 
rotting vegetation languishing in the muck. The fungi 
release a cloud of spores as the adventurers pass by, 
enveloping the surrounding area in a thick bloody red 200 
ft. radius “fog” that smells similar to fire and brimstone. 
The opaque fog heavily obscures vision (see “Vision and 
Light” in the Player’s Handbook p183). The spores coat 
exposed surfaces -- including the adventurers -- but are 
otherwise harmless. The fungi can be identified with a 
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check. The spore 
cloud disperses after an hour.
Unfortunately for the adventurers, the spore cloud is 
the least of this area’s hazards. As they wander through 
the spore cloud, a will-o’-wisp  (p301) approaches them.
You see an orb of warm light pierce through the red fog. 
As it bobs up and down excitedly, you hear a faint whisper 
that says, “Follow me, travelers. You are grave danger 
here. Hurry!”
Technically, the wisp does not lie: the adventurers are in 
grave danger. But the wisp is the danger. An adventurer 
that does not trust the wisp can roll a Wisdom (Insight) 
check against the wisp’s Charisma (Deception) check 
(+0) to gauge its intent. 
In truth, the wisp aims only to distract the adventurers 
and lead them in circles inside the spore cloud, because 
this is the hunting ground of its master, a grell (MM 
p172). If attacked, the wisp goes invisible and backs away, 
content to watch its master feed while it hisses taunts 
at the adventurers. If the grell is killed however, the wisp 
lashes out in a rage, spitting curses and vile phrases as it 
fights to the death.  (Note that the wisp’s vision is heavily 
Chapter 4: Into the Farbog

--- Page 42 ---
42obscured by the spore cloud.)
Meanwhile, the grell tries to sneak up behind the group. 
With its blindsight, the aberration isn’t affected by the 
spore cloud at all. If all the adventurers are effectively blind 
then the grell automatically succeeds in sneaking up, as it 
makes no sound while flying and the adventurers can’t see 
it. Otherwise, roll a Stealth check (+6) against the Passive 
Perception of adventurers that can see through the spore 
cloud. The aberration attacks anyone that gets separated 
from the group. If no opportunity arises, it attacks an 
adventurer that stands at the back of the group. The grell 
tries to grapple and paralyze its prey and then float away 
back to its lair with the character paralyzed character in its 
clutches.
Developments
The grell lairs in a makeshift treehouse made of petrified 
wood up in the strong, sprawling branches of a nearby oak 
tree. The treehouse is a single room that houses the grell’s 
nest made up of twigs and small branches. There are no 
ropes or ladders to reach the house, but an adventurer can climb up to it with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. 
If the grell manages to sneak off with a paralyzed 
adventurer, it brings them here before knocking them 
unconscious to be a meal for later.
Treasure
Scattered inside the treehouse is a small collection of 
items the grell kept from its previous victims. Rummaging 
through the nest will uncover 30 cp, 15 sp, 5 gp, a bag 
of holding  (DMG p153), and a wizard’s spellbook with 
the following spells written inside: alarm, color spray, 
thunderwave, unseen servant, arcane lock, rope trick .
In addition, there is a small ribbed glass bottle with a 
sparkling silvery gas floating inside. This is a message 
bottle  (see APPENDIX A). Uncorking the bottle releases 
the gas, and all in the immediate area hear the voice of 
the will-o’-wisp begin to speak, “it killed me... I watched 
it devour my body while I could do nothing... NOTHING! 
This damned beast! I hate it! It is invulnerable, cannot be 
killed, my master...” With that, the silvery gas dissipates.
 The will-o’-wisp was once a traveler that was killed

43
by the grell. With an all-consuming need for revenge, it 
assaulted the grell, only to find out that the aberration was 
completely immune to its electricity attack. The wisp was 
slowly driven insane by this revelation, and in a cruel irony, 
its shattered psyche came to love the grell that murdered 
it, helping the creature feed on passing travelers.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 1,250 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats the grell and the will-o’-wisp.
Deadly Lotus
Before running this event, it’s important that you as the 
DM know what the party’s marching order is. Specifically, 
you need to know who is marching in front and how close 
people are following behind. This is a good habit to know 
in general, but this particular event requires it.
Your dulled senses trekking through the dreary swamp 
suddenly perk up as you notice sharp, vibrant patches 
of red that practically glow in the muck ahead of you: 
beautiful red lotus flowers floating in the shallow water.
A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the remnants 
of lotus flowers around the area, but they have been 
trampled and destroyed by the zombie horde. A dozen of 
the flowers up ahead are untouched, however, as there are 
no footprints around them.
A DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check correctly identifies 
these as the rare sanguine lotus, whose petals are used to 
create powerful healing potions. If the adventurer has the 
quest “Find the Lotus” from Silvia, then they automatically 
identify the plant. The sanguine lotus are harmless and 
pose no threat to the characters. 
The quicksand that the lotus petals float in, however, 
is definitely a threat. The patch of quicksand is 20 feet 
in diameter. A DC 15 Survival check tells a character in 
advance that something is not right with the patch of 
ground containing the quicksand, but the character 
must actively be searching for such dangerous ground. 
Running or charging characters have no chance to detect 
the quicksand before falling prey to it.
Any character marching in front that isn’t aware of the 
quicksand will step in it. If one or more adventurers fall 
into the quicksand, read:
Your walk comes to an abrupt halt as you notice your feet 
have become stuck in a pool of silty water. Your feet don’t 
budge, and a moment later you start to feel a crushing 
weight on them as you slowly begin getting sucked down 
into the muck.Once a creature has set foot in quicksand, its natural 
tendency is to struggle to free itself. Any type of struggle 
will actually have the opposite effect. Moving any portion 
of the body that has been submerged causes the sand to 
shift from underneath the moved body part, thus sucking it 
deeper into the morass. The best way to escape quicksand 
is to simply lie still. Once a creature stops struggling, it 
will naturally float just as it would if it were in a pool of 
still water, albeit rising more slowly due to the weight of 
the sand.
Effects of Quicksand: Characters in quicksand must 
make a DC 10 Swim check every round to simply tread 
water in place, or a DC 15 Swim check to move 5 feet. 
Failing these checks by 5 or more results in sinking and 
the very real possibility of drowning.
Rescue:  Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand 
can be difficult. The rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, 
rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim 
with one end of it. Then he must make a DC 15 Strength 
check to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must 
make a DC 10 Strength check to hold onto the branch, 
pole, or rope. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 
5 feet closer to safety. If the victim fails to hold on, he must 
make a DC 15 Swim check immediately to stay above the 
surface. 
The quicksand isn’t the only danger here, however. A 
lumberknot  (statted as a shambling mound ; MM p270) 
(PICTURE ) lies dormant nearby, perfectly blended into the 
undergrowth. When an adventurer falls into the quicksand, 
the lumberknot comes to life and lurches towards the 
party to consume them.
Suddenly the undergrowth near the quicksand rises from 
the ground. A rotting heap of oak looms up half again as 
tall as a human, its midsection bursting open to reveal 
a cruel gaping “maw” crowned by rows of savage, stake-
like “teeth.” It shambles towards you, the roots and vines 
wrapped around its figure animating and stretching out in 
your direction.
The lumberknot moves at a slow 20 feet, so adventurers 
not stuck in quicksand can potentially outrun it. If 
brought below 30 hit points, the treefolk feigns death, 
collapsing into a rotting heap of inanimate vegetation. 
If not subsequently killed, the central root-stem, the 
lumberknot’s “brain,” beds down in its remains to slowly 
regrow its full body.
Developments
The adventurers can collect up to a dozen sanguine lotus 
if they can retrieve them from the quicksand. The lotus 
petals last for a week before rotting. If they are returned 
Chapter 4: Into the Farbog

44gold, silver, and a pearl left over. The shovels left here, 
the hurriedly removed jewelery, and the running footprints 
leaving the area point that the robbers were fleeing.
Adventurers can track the footprints or follow where 
Anna pointed (she cannot venture too far from her 
grave). Along the way, they come across a charred corpse 
clutching a pearl necklace missing a bead. This was one of 
the robbers, and it looks like he was burned alive.
The characters can continue following the track until 
they come across a roadside shrine where the second 
robber is staying.
Up ahead the muddy swamp floor abruptly gives away to 
a circle dry earth. Sprouting in the midst of this circle is 
a wide pine tree stump. Carved from what used to be its 
trunk and rising up from its stump is the symbol of the 
Church: Avacyn’s Collar.
Sitting beside the shrine is a human clothed in 
mudcaked wools and leathers. He cautiously holds a light 
crossbow in his hands, his tired eyes constantly scanning 
the swamps around him. 
The second robber, Bran Halfhelm (a commoner; MM 
345), has stayed at this road shrine for two days now. He 
is a refugee from Mordov (see “Refugees”). Him and his 
brother, Rickard, managed to escape the slaughter by 
running deep into the farbog. They hoped to cross the 
swamp and seek shelter at one of the northern villages. 
Fleeing with just the clothes on their backs, they happened 
upon Anna’s grave site and decided to rob it for a chance 
to have enough money to pay for a hot meal and a place 
to stay once they reached a village.
Unfortunately for Bran and Rickard, their grave robbery 
awoke the spirits, and two fiery geists (Anna’s parents) 
chased them down. Rickard was caught and burned alive, 
but Bran managed to reach the safety of this roadside 
shrine, where the angry spirits cannot reach him. He is 
certain that the geists are waiting for him to leave the 
circle to kill him.
Bran begs the adventurers to protect him from the 
geists. At first, he does not mention that he robbed the 
graves, only that angry geists chased him here and killed 
his brother. If the adventurers press him, Bran will reveal 
the truth, but stress that he was desperate, having lost 
everything to the zombie horde, and needs the money to 
pay for basic needs if he ever gets out of the swamp (which 
is true). He argues that the dead don’t need jewelery.
If the adventurers convince Bran to hand over his 
stolen jewlery, he gives them a gold ring with etchings of 
soaring herons on its outside (worth 25gp), and a silver 
bracelet with a sapphire stylishly embedded into its center 
(worth 20gp). The gold ring is one of two wedding rings 
-- Bran withholds the second one, though an appropriate alive to Silvia, she pays the adventurers 50 gp (-5gp for 
each missing lotus) and gives them three vials of life’s 
blood (see APPENDIX A).

A Little Girl’s Plea
As the adventurers travel through the farbog, or perhaps 
while they stop to rest, they are approached by a geist 
(spirit).
A voice calls out to you: it sounds like a little girl, but the 
voice is strange, warped, like hearing the message through 
the end of a long metal tube. “Please, misters. Please help 
me! Mum and dad are hurting and left me. Will you bring 
them back to me?” Looking around, you notice a small 
humanoid figure, her features hidden under silken sheets. 
The spirit’s translucent body emits a soft pale glow.
The ghost is of Anna Helmvin, a little girl that died here 
long ago in a time when the barren swamp held a thriving 
community. She poses no threat to the characters, but 
follows them for a while, begging them to help her. If 
attacked, she turns invisible and runs away sobbing.
Anna will freely answer any questions the adventurers 
have, but her knowledge is restricted by when she was 
“awake” and is filtered through her child psyche. Here is a 
list of things she knows that the characters may ask about:
• This place was once a village. People were happy.
• Anna and her parents died when their house burned 
down. Anna died in her room, her parents died trying 
to save her.
• Her parent’s spirits were really sad and angry for not 
saving Anna, but eventually all of them found peace 
in the Blessed Sleep when the villagers buried them
• Anna doesn’t know what happened around here while 
she was sleeping.
• Anna and her parents woke up recently when “bad 
men” dug up their graves.
• Anna can lead characters to the graves, and point 
them in the direction that the “bad men” fled to.
The grave site is located on a small hill not far from 
where the adventurers meet Anna. The three graves have 
been dug up and the shovels used for the digging have 
been left on the ground beside them. The remains of Anna 
and her parents are still in their graves, however a DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) reveals to anyone searching 
the bodies that jewelery -- rings, necklaces, braclets -- 
have clearly been ripped off the skeletons, with bits of 
Chapter 4: Into the Farbog

--- Page 45 ---

Intelligence check can figure out that there should be 
two wedding rings, or a Wisdom (Insight) check notices 
that Bran might be holding something back. Though he’s 
desperate for some money, Bran values his life above all 
else, so he’ll hand over the final item if pressured to.
Developments
The ghosts of Anna’s parents cannot enter the shrine’s 
circle, so they patiently wait. If Bran leaves 300 feet from 
the shrine’s circle, they materialize as two fire geists  
(APPENDIX B) and attack him relentlessly. If Bran dies, 
they will then attack anyone else holding their wedding 
rings.
Defeating the geists does not satisfy Anna, who says 
that her parents are still hurting, and they’ll just come 
back later. She thinks that “putting their stuff back” will be 
the only way her parents will go back to sleep.
Returning the wedding rings back to the parent’s graves 
is the only way to return their spirits to the Blessed Sleep. 
If this is done:
You feel a soothing breeze pass by you. Anna appears 
in front of you, no longer shrouded in silks but a happy, 
beaming girl in a dress. Standing right behind her parents, 
smiling at nodding at you. “You gave me back my mommy 
and daddy. Thank you!” The three spirits then fade away.

Corpse Wagons
Run this encounter only if the adventurers have been 
following the zombie horde’s tracks.
While the horde’s tracks move south away from Mauer 
Estate, some wagon tracks are spotted moving north, 
back toward the estate. These are the wagons that were 
filled with corpses and sent back to Siegfried.
As the adventurers follow the tracks, they come across 
one of these wooden corpse wagons sitting in their path. 
The wagon is filled with corpses. The four zombies that 
were pulling the wagon are found on the ground just in 
front of it. They have been cut down neatly into a pile of 
body parts. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check 
while observing the bodies notes that they were cut down 
with clean, precise cuts from a sharp weapon, possibly 
a sword. Additionally, characters can spot new footprints 
near the zombies: human bootprints, two pairs. A DC 
15 Intelligence (Investigation) check notes that these 
boots are plate greaves, part of a set of plate armor. The 
bootprints appeared a few paces from the zombies and 
approached them; there’s signs of brief struggle, then the 
bootprints walked a few paces and mysteriously vanish.
In truth, this was the work of vampires. House Falkenrath 
has become worried about Siegfried’s activities. When 
they found out that the necro-alchemist was collecting 
bodies, they sent some of their kin to intercept the corpse 
wagons to deprive Siegfried of supplies. These two

46vampires landed at the wagon, quickly dispatched of the 
zombies pulling it, and then flew away.
If the adventurers continue following the zombie horde’s 
tracks for another hour, they come to a second wagon just 
as the zombies escorting it are being cut down. Hans 
and Franz, two vampire spawn warriors  (APPENDIX B) 
(PICTURE ), quickly dispatch the zombies with little effort. 
As you continue walking, you spot the hazy form of a 
wagon about three hundred feet away at the mist’s edge.  It 
is slowly moving north, being pulled by three humanoids. 
Suddenly, two humanoids with large pale wings appear in 
the sky above, plunging through the mist to the wagon. 
There are brief sounds of a commotion; staggered groans, 
then silence again. 
The vampires linger beside the wagon for a few minutes 
to chat. Hans complains about their assignment, saying 
this is grunt work, that his new boots are caked in mud, 
the bog reeks, and that there’s a small hamlet not far from 
here they can stop by to “get a bite to eat.” Franz scolds 
Hans, telling him to take the assignment seriously and 
stop complaining, that he needs to exercise more and 
isn’t “pumped up” enough.
If the adventurers do not approach or are not spotted, 
the two vampires fly away after a few minutes. 
If the vampires notice the adventurers and aren’t 
immediately attacked, they try to strike up conversation:
The two figures turn to you. Both wear fine red silken 
clothes under their armor; red enameled plate with gold 
trim. Both have strange, wondrous eyes, golden irisis 
swimming in pools of black sclera. Their pale faces wear 
very different expressions: one man a cold grimace, the 
other man a haughty smirk.
“It seems we have company, Franz,” the man says, “a 
band of seasoned looking fellows, heading north... oh! You 
must be the ‘Heroes of Shadowgrange!’ Such an honor!” 
he says, performing a mock bow.
Hans wants to banter with the adventurers, as he’s bored 
and looking for entertainment. Franz, however, is a no-
nonsense kind of vampire and wants to finish taking out 
the corpse wagons so that they can head home.
Franz is tight-lipped when dealing with the adventurers, 
while Hans does entertain questions, albeit with mocking 
sarcasm. For example, if asked what the vampires are 
doing here, he replies, “taking a stroll, of course. The 
farbog is lovely this time of year.” He does congratulate 
the adventurers, however, saying that the Falkenraths 
are happy they aided Shadowgrange and “protected the 
cattle.” The vampires are just as opposed to the zombie 
horde -- and Siegfried’s other machinations -- as everyone is, because the vampires rely on healthy, thriving human 
settlements as food.
If asked to help defeat Siegfried, Hans explains that 
the alchemist is holed up in the Mauer Estate and that 
the building has a protective holy ward that prevents the 
vampires from attacking directly. He is willing to help the 
adventurers if they deal with Siegfried for the vampires; 
for example, he’s willing to find out what happened to 
Katarina and relay that information to them, after the 
estate’s holy wards are taken down. 
The vampires defend themselves if attacked or provoked 
enough, but they are under strict orders not to kill the 
characters, a fact that Franz must remind Hans. The 
Falkenrath know of the adventurers’ quest and would like 
to see the party do the dirty work of disposing Siegfried for 
them. If one vampire is killed, the other attempts to flee, 
swearing revenge (maybe returning with other vampires 
to attack the party in a future adventure).

Conclusion of Part 4
On the end of the second day of travel, the party reaches 
the end of the swamp.
You leave the black muck of the farbog behind and are 
greeted with a fresh breeze to the open valley ahead of 
you. Soft rolling hills cascade ahead of you, flanked by the 
jagged stone valley walls.
Up a few miles ahead is a grove of greenery rising up 
from the short grass. Poking up from its center, high above 
the forest ceiling, is a twisting stone tower adorned by 
glistening metal contraptions. The tower shimmers with 
wisps of pale lights, like ribbons dancing in the breeze.
Angry dark clouds gather over the valley. They seem 
to concentrate over the grove, as if nature’s wrath was 
winding up to smite the tower. Quick flashes of lightning 
pop from inside the restless clouds. A storm is coming...
The adventurers have nearly reached the end of their 
journey: Mauer Estate stands defiantly in front of them. 
They need only cross the valley, descend into the thicket’s 
center, and enter.

Sixty miles north of Shadowgrange, nestled in a clearing at 
the center of a grove of live oak trees deep within northern 
Stensia, stands Mauer Estate. The mansion is one of the 
oldest buildings in the region, its foundation dating back 
thousands of years to a holy sect of paladins that brought 
the Light to Innistrad long before even Avacyn. Since then, 
countless occupants have claimed Mauer Estate as their 
home, modifying the grounds to suit their needs.
Siegfried is the estate’s current owner and uses it as 
his base of operations. Ever since he fled Shadowgrange 
in the wake of his beloved Katarina’s kidnapping (see 
“Background” in Introduction), the alchemist spends his 
days here working tirelessly to carry out his goal of revenge. 
Siegfried descent into madness has attracted demons to 
his cause. The fiends aid in his work and whisper dark 
secrets that further taint his warped psyche.
A great storm brews overhead: part of Siegfried’s 
machinations, in fact. The mad alchemist seeks to harness 
the storm’s power to bring his ultimate creation to life. The adventurers have a chance to confront Siegfried and 
put a stop to his nefarious schemes. And of course, untold 
riches await those brave enough to explore the ancient 
areas hidden deep inside the estate.
The Grove
Mauer Estate’s grove is nestled deep within the farbog. 
The small forest is comprised of a half mile radius of oak 
trees ( PICTURE ). The trees’ thick sprawling branches 
intertwine with their neighbors, obscuring vision and 
making it difficult to navigate through the area.
The oak trees are littered with what look like normal 
wood knots at a distance, but closer inspection shows 
these lumps are all have human shapes -- agonized faces, 
outstretched hands -- as if people were trapped inside 
the bark. Destroying the lumps only finds ordinary wood, 
however.
The telltale signs of the zombie horde’s trek -- hundreds

48of footprints and wagon wheels -- lead from the grove 
south to the swamp. Adventurers can easily track them 
north to the grove’s main entrance, a path carved through 
the trees specifically to allow the horde to pass through. 
The branches and trees that were in the path’s way were 
smashed and splintered by skaab abominations and the 
debris tossed to the side.
The adventurers don’t need to follow the main path 
into the grove; they are free to enter the grove from any 
direction. However, the main path is the only method of 
traveling unimpeded through the grove: walking through 
from anywhere else requires navigating up and around 
the twisting jungle of low-hanging live oak branches.
Lady of the Woods
The adventurers attract the curiosity of Eudora, a dryad  
(MM p121) ( PICTURE ) living in the grove. Eudora casts 
pass without trace before following the party sneakily. 
As you make your way through the grove, you hear youthful 
feminine voice whisper in your ear, “My my, what do we 
have here? I rarely have living visitors in my woods. Who 
are you, and why have you come?” Out of the corner of 
your eyes you catch a glimpse of a feminine form flitting 
through the trees before its gone again with only warm 
laughter hanging in the air.
While Eudora probes the characters for information, the 
dryad uses her tree stride  to keep a distance from the 
adventurers and ducks into hiding when she’s out of 
sight, using her +15 Dexterity (Stealth).
If the adventurers explain why they are here and she is 
convinced that they mean her no harm, she reveals herself 
to them. Eudora appears as a statuesque beauty, youthful 
and alluring. Her hair and tight-fitting dress are made of 
autumn leaves: vibrant fiery hues of yellow, orange, and 
red. The dryad radiates vigor and primal magic. 
Hippie Personality
Eudora is a social creature that has been deprived of 
humanoid companions for a long time. Because of this, 
she is utterly delighted to have an opportunity to speak 
with friendly adventurers. 
The dryad places a great deal of importance on good 
emotions. She wants to make sure everyone is feeling 
“good vibes,” and advocates decision making to “follow 
your heart” instead of cold, rational logic.
If any character is visibly upset, or if there is any fighting 
amongst the group, Eudora tries to intervene in mediate, 
asking what is wrong, and what are the deeper issues at 
play. Was the character abused as a child? Did they have 
a good relationship with their parents? The dryad loves taking the role of a therapist and mediator.
What the Dryad Knows
Eudora has never left the grove and knows little of the 
outside world. She doesn’t know anything about current 
events, though she is not a fan of Avacyn due to the 
archangel’s persecution of druidism and “the old ways” 
connected to the forest.
If asked about Siegfried, Eudora tells them that she 
helped a grief-stricken man make it to Mauer Estate (fed 
him goodberries and let him rest), that he would’ve been 
beautiful if his soul wasn’t wracked with anger and sadness. 
The dryad regrets helping him, as the alchemist has been 
working day and night producing undead monstrosities, 
abominations and mockeries of nature. His foul work only 
causes ruin and misery.
If asked about the human-like lumps in the oak trees, 
Eudora explains that long ago, when Avacyn arrived, the 
“people of the forest” rejected her and her new religion, 
preferring to stick to the old ways. Avacyn punished them 
for this.
Eudora’s Offer
The dryad explains that she is lonely. Long ago, when the 
grove stretched all the way to the swamp, humans used 
to live in harmony with nature. In those times she had 
many visitors, many intimate friends. But slowly the forest 
receded and the world filled with darkness, and she was 
left here alone. What the dryad wants the most is a taste 
of that intimacy she enjoyed so long ago. 
Having no love for the alchemist in Mauer Estate and 
his foul projects, Euroda offers to help the adventurers. 
She knows of a secret path that leads inside the mansion. 
But she wants something in return: each adventurer must 
stand up in front of the group and reveal an intimate 
secret about themselves that no one else in the group 
knows. Eudora explains that her most cherished moments 
with her intimate friends was when they left themselves 
emotionally open and vulnerable to others as an ultimate 
act of trust, and she wants to taste that experience one 
more time. The dryad warns that if any of them refuse her 
offer or lie, she will not show them the hidden passage.
This is a fun opportunity for roleplaying. It gives each 
character a spotlight to flesh out their characters and 
give the group a mutual understanding of one another. 
The intimate secret can be something silly, like a fear 
of butterflies, or more serious, like the characters’ 
motivations for adventuring.
 Eudora conducts the event like a group therapy meeting: 
she leads the group, asking each character in turn to share 
their story. She is polite and strives to keep the group a 
safe and calm environment, thanking each one for sharing 
Chapter 5: The Perfect Storm

and taking her time to relish the experience. For example, 
if she particularly enjoys a story, she may close her eyes, 
take a deep breath, and smile as she exhales. “That felt 
true. I felt it, right here,” pointing to where a human’s 
heart would be.
Developments
If each character reveals an intimate secret to the dryad’s 
satisfaction, or if they manage to convincingly pass off a 
fake tale as true, then Eudora leads them to a large live 
oak tree. The dryad utters a simple spell and the tree 
partially uproots itself, revealing a tunnel underneath: this 
tunnel leads to the kitchen (area A6) in Mauer Estate. The 
earthen tunnel is roughly dug but stable; there is no light, 
and the roots of the trees above dangle from its ceiling.
Eudora cannot accompany the adventurers into Mauer 
Estate. The dryad explains that she is magically bound 
to the grove and cannot leave its boundaries. The forest 
clearing which the estate resides is so filled with twisted 
magic that it’s severed from nature, making her unable 
to enter it. If the adventurers make a good impression on 
her, however, she casts goodberry three times and gives 
them the berries for their journey, wishing them good luck.
If attacked, Eudora flees, using tree stride  to help her 
escape. She would much rather flee than fight.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 1,500 XP equally among the characters if the party 
reveals their intimate secrets.
Mauer Estate
If the adventurers trek to the center of the grove they 
eventually reach a clearing where Mauer Estate resides. 
The storm above them begins in earnest, pouring down 
heavy rain and periodically striking the rooftop with 
lightning. ( PICTURE ) (MAP )
A cold rain begins pouring down as you reach the forest 
clearing. The heavy rainfall obscures your vision; angry gray 
storm clouds foaming overhead acts as a thick curtain, 
blocking light and leaving the clearing in a grim shadow. 
Leering down at you from the center of the clearing is the 
manor-house: Mauer Estate. Twisting up from the center 
of the rooftop is a stone tower, its flat ceiling crowded with 
a messy array of metal instrument of various shapes and 
sizes. Shimmering ribbons of soft pale light hang in the 
air surrounding the tower.
An explosive flash of lightning slams down upon a 
large metallic sphere atop the tower and is immediately 
followed by the boom of thunder. Electricity dances upon 
the metal apparatus and skips down long tubes attached 
to it that descends into the tower.Looking around the Estate, the players hear/see:
You hear the sounds of shoveling up ahead. Circling the 
estate’s perimeter are humanoids shoveling the muddy 
earth in awkward jerky movement, sending mud flying to 
the side. Torn bits of muddy rags cling to their wet rotting 
bodies.
20 zombies (MM p316) surround the mansion, using 
shovels to dig a shallow trench that circles the entire 
building. Siegfried commanded the trench be dug for a 
future project to fortify his base of operations. The zombies 
are focused on their task, so much that adventurers could 
walk past them without any reaction from the undead. 
Attacking a zombie draws their attention, however, 
and 1d6+3 nearby zombies shamble over to attack the 
adventurers. If they lose sight of the adventurers, for 
example of the characters flee into the woods, then the 
zombies return to their work.
The main features of Mauer Estate that adventurers can 
reasonably spot in the heavy rain are:
• A pair of towering silvery doors on the southern side 
of the mansion: the main entrance (A1)
• The stables, a smaller, open building attached to the 
eastern wall of the estate estate (A7)
• Wooden double doors on the north side of the estate 
leading down into the cellar (A8)
• A DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check notes two 
marble statues standing in alcoves flanking the main 
entrance. The statues are female angels in silken 
gowns covering their faces with their hands as they 
weep, the rain washing down their faces like tears. A 
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) recognizes these statues 
as portraying angels of the flight alabaster, protectors 
of humans both living and dead. (These are manor 
gargoyles ; see “Climbing the Walls” below)
• A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a stained 
glass window above the main entrance. It depicts an 
emblem with a pouncing lion. A DC 15 Intelligence 
(History) recognizes as the emblem of the House 
Lowe, an ancient family of nobles that was wiped out 
long ago by the neighboring vampire families.
Entering the Estate
There are four main ways of entering the estate:
• Go through the mansion’s front door (A1)
• Entering through the door connected to the stables 
(A7)
• Adventurers entering the estate from Eudora’s secret 
passage (see “Lady of the Woods”) find themselves in 
Chapter 5: The Perfect Storm

--- Page 50 ---
50the kitchen (A6).
• Climb up to the rooftop and enter the laboratory (A10) 
through an open hatch (see “Climbing the Walls”).
Of course, creative adventurers may find other methods 
of entrance; roll with their zany ideas when possible!
Climbing the Walls
Unorthodox adventurers may attempt to scale the walls. 
Climbing the rain-slicked walls in the dark is difficult even 
for trained climbers, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) 
check.
Adventurers attempting to climb also attract the 
attention of the 2 manor gargoyles (MM p140) disguised 
as angelic statues. They wait until the last adventurers 
begin their ascent before striking.
A shriek pierces the hiss of the driving rain. Swooping 
down at you on outstretched wings are two angelic figures 
with marble-like surfaces. Their statuesque feminine 
bodies are a stark contrast to their fiendish faces; small 
mischievous eyes stare at you behind a squished snout 
and rows of razor-sharp teeth. They make pig-like squeals 
and snorts as they cackle and close in on you.
In addition to their claws and bite, the gargoyles may try 
to drop climbers off the wall. They do so by grappling the 
target (action), moving away from the wall with them (move at half speed), and dropping them (free action). 
The gargoyles flee if taken below 20 hit points or if one of 
them is destroyed.
It’s nearly impossible to climb into the second floor 
windows; the windows are all blocked with stone and 
plaster. In fact, most of the second floor has been filled 
with earth and stone; Siegfried did away with unnecessary 
space, denying extra methods for would-be intruders to 
access his lair.
There are, however, three available ways that climbing 
adventurers can enter the mansion. The first is by 
smashing through the stained glass window into the main 
hall (A2). The second is going down the chimney leading 
to the dining hall’s fireplace (A5). The third is climbing to 
the peak of the estate, the top of the alchemy lab (A10), 
where they can enter through an open ceiling hatch. 
Lightning Strikes.  Traversing the top of the tower is 
highly dangerous: lightning frequently strikes the metal 
apparatuses. As an adventurer climbs over, roll 1d6; on 
a 6, lightning strikes the top of the tower. Adventurers 
caught in the blast must make a DC 15 Dexterity save, 
taking 8d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a success. 
Ward of Radiance
Ribbons of pale light, like a miniature version of the 
Northern Lights, surround the tower as well. These lights 
are projections of pure radiant energy. Climbers in close

proximity to these lights may feel an uncomfortable 
warmth coming from inside of them or restless energy, 
but nothing debilitating. Fiends and undead, however, 
feel a searing pain when close to these lights, taking 1d6 
radiant damage per turn and must make a DC 15 Wisdom 
save or be frightened for 1 minute.
Area A1 - The Great Doors
A pair of towering silvery doors act as the main entrance 
into the manse, leading to the main hall (area A2). Their 
shining silvery surfaces act as two great mirrors that show 
the reflection of anyone approaching.
As the adventurers approach the doors they hear a 
booming voice that asks them the following riddle:
Always running
Never walking
Sometimes babbles
But never talking
What am I?
(The answer is a river.)
Alternatively, replace this riddle with any other that you’d 
like, or a different puzzle entirely. Or, if you’re not fond of 
riddles/puzzles at all, the doors can ask for a password, or 
state of intent, before allowing entry.
If the adventurers do not answer to the door’s 
satisfaction, they do not open. Any attempt to force 
the doors open causes the doors -- which are actually 2 
mimics (MM p220) -- to attack.
The two silvery doors suddenly fly out of the door frame 
towards you. Their flat surfaces quickly stretch and warp 
into giant gaping maws with long, powerful tongues 
curling back as if readying itself to swat at you.
In combat, the mimics attack with their pseudopod 
“tongue.” Once the target is grappled, the mimic reels in 
the target for a vicious bite (attacks with advantage due 
to its Grappler trait). The mimics have been tasked with 
guarding the entrance and fight to the death, but do not 
chase fleeing adventurers outside of the grove clearing.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 900 XP equally among the characters if the party 
answers the riddle or defeats the mimics.
Area A2 - Main Hall
The main hall can be accessed by passing through the 
great doors (A1), the west parlor (A3), the dining hall 
(A4), or smashing through the stained glass windows 
(see “Climbing the Walls”).The ruinous remains of fine marble pillars line the hallway 
here; some toppled over, others reaching up to the vaulted 
ceiling but coming short of the top. Hollow suits of armor 
are on display along the wall, standing vigil with their 
hollow gauntlets wrapped around ceremonial blades.
Bursting through the center of the hall is a cylindrical 
stone tower. Only a portion of the tower is contained in 
this hallway: its wall extends beyond the main hall, and it 
ascends beyond the ceiling.
High above, rain courses in dark rivulets down the 
stained glass windows above the main doorway. In the 
crash of lightning, the stained glass casts the chamber in 
flashes of red and violet.
Paired doors stand to your left and right. Across the 
hall, a shiny brass door offers a way inside the tower.
The door to the left leads to the west parlor (A3), the door 
to the right leads to the dining hall (A5), and finally up 
ahead leads into the tower’s staircase (A9).
Each step causes the old eroding wooden floor to creak 
ominously. Six suits of armor on display have engravings 
of moon motifs and of soaring herons. They are rusted and 
are littered with dust and cobwebs. Three of the suits of 
armor on display are in fact haunted guardians: animated 
armors  (MM p19) ( PICTURE ) holding flying swords  
(MM p20); they are indistinguishable from mundane 
items unless a character can detect magic. Siegfried cast 
prestidigitation to make them look old and unused. 
A character investigating the brass doorway into the 
tower notices a small nearly invisible message on the 
door.  A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check recognizes this 
as a glyph of warding  spell, but not what type. The font 
is tiny and requires getting close to read it. The message 
says, “read this out loud.” 
Shouldn’t Have Done That
If a character says the message out loud, it triggers the 
explosive runes , releasing a 20-foot radius explosion of

explosion must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, 
taking 3d8 lightning damage on a failed saving throw or 
half as much damage on a successful one.
If the explosive runes are triggered or dispelled, the 3 
animated armors  holding 3 flying swords  immediately 
come to life and attack the party, fighting until destroyed.
Developments
Unless the party is deliberately being quiet, the vampire 
Lambert hears them. He uses his scroll of disguise self 
to look like a human cathar and begins shouting for help 
from inside the west parlor (A3).

Area A3 - West Parlor
The west parlor is connected to the main hall (A2).
Decades of neglect has deteriorated what was once a 
cheerful parlor. Baby-blue walls hold the slashed and torn 
remnants of old family portraits. 
Elegant chairs with poofy cushions 
surround a small wooden circular 
table, engravings of majestic 
stags run laps along its edges. A 
bookcase cover the western wall. 
Lambert Spinne, a vampire warrior  
(APPENDIX B), resides in this 
small room. 
Illusions and Trickery
If the PCs made a commotion 
either by fighting the mimics at the 
entrance (A1) or make noise inside 
the main hall (A2), Lambert uses 
one of his scrolls of disguise self 
to take the appearance of a human 
cathar before calling out for help. If 
this happens and the adventurers 
open the door, and if they have a 
light source, read or paraphrase:
Standing inside the room is a man 
that appears to be in his mid 30’s. 
He is decked head to toe in the studded leathers of a 
combat-ready cathar, a mix of white and brown, topped 
with a leather tri-corner hat.
“Thank Avacyn, someone has come! Please, help! The 
madman owner of this house has kept me prisoner here, 
says he plans to experiment on me. Please, before his foul 
minions arrive!”
Lambert speaks the truth: Siegfried is indeed keeping 
him prisoner for future experiments. He’s certainly 
withholding information, however. If questioned, the 
vampire disguised as a cathar keeps repeating that he’ll 
explain everything once he’s free, that they must hurry 
before patrols come.
Trapped
The vampire explains what is keeping him here: it is not a 
physical barrier, but a magical one. He points to a straight unbroken line of silver powder on the ground under the 
doorway. He hurries them in an anxious voice to wipe 
away the line of powder so that he can escape.
The powdered silver radiates an aura of magic 
(abjuration). Inquisitive characters can make a DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) or (Religion) check to recognize the 
line of powdered silver as a magic circle against evil. The 
magic circle binds Lambert; he cannot cross the line’s 
boundary until the line is broken, nor can he disturb the 
line himself.
Anyone other than the vampire 
can dispel the magic circle 
by simply breaking the line of 
powdered silver, for example 
sweeping it away with their foot.
Lambert’s True Self
If they catch Lambert unaware, 
see through his illusion, or the 
vampire spawn drops his disguise 
self spell, they instead see a 
gaunt, pale-skinned man in fine 
aristocratic clothing that looks 
straight out of a Victorian nobel’s 
wardrobe: a vest of red and gold, 
high black leather boots, a black 
high-collared cape that is red on 
the inside. Lambert’s striking 
eyes; golden irises in a pool of 
black sclera, are a telltale sign 
of vampirism, glinting in the 
darkness like a cat’s. ( PICTURE )
Like most vampires, Lambert 
has a smug sense of superiority 
over mortals, which he compares 
his own kind as “shepherds watching over our sheep.” 
He acts with restraint towards the characters, which he 
respects to some degree for making it this far. He watches 
them with curiosity and amusement.
Interview With The Vampire
If the adventurers don’t fall for his ruse, Lambert changes 
tactics. Instead of relying on the characters’ good will, he 
entices them with money, power, and information. He 
explains that he is from a very rich and influential family, 
the Voldaren vampires. Lambert guarantees that the 
characters will be handsomely rewarded if they free him.
If the characters are willing to negotiate his release for 
information, wealth, or power, Lambert has one request: 
step into his parlor. A character (one or more) has to sit 
down at the table with him during the talks as a sign of 
good faith. He gives his word that he will not harm anyone

that enters the room so long as they do not attack him.
What Lambert Knows
Lambert is willing to barter information for his release. He 
has only been a vampire for two years now and does not 
know any secrets that would be left for Voldaren elders, 
but he can readily answer any general questions about 
Stensia and Innistrad that an average citizen would know.
In addition, he has juicy bits of information that the 
characters may be interested in:
• He participated in Katarina’s abduction (see 
“Voldaren’s Lesson” in the Introduction) and her 
subsequent “crowning” as a mock “Queen of the 
Vampires,” but was not permitted to feast on her at 
the celebrations’ end, “unfortunately there’s only so 
much blood to go around.”
• The vampire families were disturbed when they found 
out about the zombie horde laying waste to the 
countryside. They followed the corpse wagons (and 
destroyed the zombies pulling them) back to Mauer 
Estate
• Lambert was sent to spy on Siegfried, but the Estate 
is incredibly well protected against vampires: he 
specifically mentions the strange aura of radiant 
energy surrounding the tower which “seared my flesh 
as I approached”
• The vampire was eventually caught by Siegfried and is 
now kept here for future experiments
Developments
If Lambert tricks the adventurers into breaking the magic 
circle against evil with his disguise, keeps up his act long 
enough for him to break from the party and escape. He 
isn’t looking for a fight, instead hoping to return home as 
quickly as possible.
If the adventurers see through his ruse and agree to 
negotiate for his release by entering his room, Lambert 
keeps his word of not harming them. He can promise 
them riches for his release, within reason -- treat his 
promised riches as a Treasure Horde CR 5 (DMG p137) to 
see what he can and cannot give. If they agree on a price 
and free the vampire, a week later a package arrives to the 
characters with the promised items. 
Or he can promise a favor from his brethren: what that 
favor ends up being is up to you. For example, he could 
put in a good word towards the vampire elders, should 
any character wish to become “gifted” with vampirism. 
Other favors could be free passage alongside Voldaren’s 
territories, or a promise not to feast on people living in a 
specific village for a full year.
If the characters refuse to release him, the vampire 
shouts insults at them as they leave, warning them that when he is freed he and his brethren will hunt the party 
down and devour them for their insolence. He may show 
up in the future with a few vampires to attack the party.
If pressed into combat, Lambert’s only hope is to fight 
them inside his room, as the vampire has no ranged 
capabilities. But he can get out of line of sight easily, 
hiding in corners of the room so that anyone looking to 
attack him would have to enter to get a clear shot.
Secret Room
The bookcase is filled with books ranging from a variety 
of topics, including history, biology, geography, etc. A 
DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) both reveals a sliding 
mechanism around the bookcase and that one book, 
“Camoflage and Its Practical Applications,”  stands out 
amongst the rest. Pulling on the book swings the bookcase 
open, revealing a hidden room (A4).

Treasure
The vampire was stripped of most notable possessions, 
but he managed to keep two scrolls of disguise self hidden 
inside his boots.
Most of the dusty tomes on the bookcase are valuable 
(10-30gp each), but two are particularly noteworthy: 
The Sacred Waters of Sumnerryl , describes the location 
of an ancient sinkhole hidden away in province Kessig 
whose waters are rumored to contain mystical powers. It 
would be worth 150gp to the druids of Kessig, plus could 
be a hook for a future adventure.
Fall From Glory  is actually a hollowed out book holding 
a golden hourglass. The “sand” of the hourglass is 
powdered ruby. The hourglass is worth 400gp to the right 
(extremely wealthy) buyer.
Area A4 - Hidden Room
This room is accessed via a secret doorway in the parlor 
(A3). None of Mauer Estate’s current inhabitants know 
about this room, making it the perfect spot for adventurers 
to rest. A lever on a wall inside the room opens and closes 
the secret entrance.
A font bubbles in the middle this small room, its silver 
liquid sparkling with fair dawn’s light. Encircling its broad 
base is a mosaic depicting a silver heron and a dark 
fiendish goat in eternal chase. An inscription is written on 
the font’s rim.
Font of Bennu
Chapter 5: The Perfect Storm

--- Page 54 ---
54This blessed font is said to grant knowledge through visions 
to those who partake without avarice. The inscription 
on the font’s rim reads in Celestial, “A blessing for the 
righteous; a curse for avarice.” Anyone who drinks from 
the font experiences a vision of the past and potentially 
the future. The imbiber gains a bit of magical potential, 
whose benefit that character can activate at a time of their 
choosing. Once activated, the benefit is expended.
A character who drinks from the fountain more than 
once is afflicted with the disfavor of Bennu. The character 
does not receive the font’s benefit, instead gaining a level 
of exhaustion.
When a character drinks from the font for the first 
time, roll 1d4 and consult the following list. You can also 
improvise or create specific visions, perhaps revealing 
additional story information that hints at future adventures 
beyond this one.
1. Vision of Sacrifice: The character witnesses a massive 
black rupture in the sky, fiends and other horrors emerging 
from it. A glowing heron flies into the portal and erupts 
into a mist of silver. There is a blinding flash of light which 
then dims to reveal the silver moon of Innistrad.
Benefit:  As a reaction, the character can claim this 
benefit when an ally they can see within 30 feet of them 
takes damage, taking that damage instead and negating 
half of it.
2. Vision of Past Valor: The characters witness a scene 
of Avacyn fighting with an equally powerful demon 
(Griselbrand), the Helvault standing in the background.
Benefit:  As a free action, the character can claim this 
benefit to take an additional bonus action.
3. Vision of Inspiration: This vision shows the Church 
of Avacyn at the height of its power, humans and angels 
working together to drive the horrors away from their 
lands.
Benefit:  As a free action, the character can claim this 
benefit to gain an inspiration point.
4. Vision of Future Glory: This vision shows a huge silver 
mass (the Helvault) standing at the center of a garden. 
The object explodes with a flash of radiance and an army 
of devils stream out. 
Benefit:  As a free action, the character can claim this 
benefit to gain an additional Dash action.
Area A5 - Dining Hall
A vaulted hall stretches before you, anchored by a great 
stone fireplace on one end and a wall decked in old 
ceremonial swords on the other. Between them are three 
long tables capable of seating an entire company. Rotting 
body parts are heaped on the tables in great hideous piles: 
arms, legs, heads, and other parts. Old wooden bowls, drinking horns, and knives are strewn about the floor 
mixed in with debris.
The stone tower at the center of the manse cuts a swath 
into this hall, jutting out of a corner. A dumbwaiter has 
been built into the tower, its metal cart suspended by thick 
ropes.
The dining hall can be accessed by the main hall (A2), the 
kitchen (A6), or through the fireplace (see “Climbing the 
Walls”).
The corpses littering the tables have been brought 
here from the corpse wagons sitting in the stables (A6). 
Shilgengar, the demonlord of ashmouth  (Appendix B) and 
his five crawling claw  helpers (MM p44) work here day 
and night. They chop up the corpses into body parts and 
sort them into piles (head, arms, legs, torso, hands, feet) 
on the tables.
The shaft on the tower wall is a dumbwaiter: it leads 
from the dining hall to the top of the tower (A10) where 
Siegfried works. Periodically, a quasit from the top of the 
tower (A10) calls down the shaft of the dumbwaiter for a 
specific body part. Shilgengar and his helpers fill the cart 
with the body part, then the demon turns a crank that lifts 
the cart up to the tower with ropes on pulleys.
Shilgengar has been commanded by a powerful 
archdemon to aid Siegfried with his projects and push 
him further towards utter madness. While the taskmaster 
has been overseeing supplying Siegfried with body parts, 
his accomplice, the quasit Qarr (A10), whispers fiendish 
suggestions in the stitcher’s ear.
Shilgengar relishes the chance to inflict pain on any 
invaders. If taken below 20 hit points, the demon tries 
to retreat, ideally by flying up the dumbwaiter shaft and 
warning Siegfried (A10). If killed, the demonlord’s essence 
dissolves and reforms inside the pits of ashmouth 
months or years later, ready to enact his vengeance on the 
adventurers.
Going Up The Dumbwaiter
A crank operates the dumbwaiter, raising or lowering the 
metal crate inside the shaft. Turning the crank requires a 
Strength check: the DC is 5 for an empty crate, up to 15 
when it’s at maximum capacity. An adventurer can operate 
the crank while the rest of the party is in the crate to send 
them up the shaft.
Alternatively, adventurers can climb up the shaft. 
Climbing the thick ropes attached to the crate requires 
at DC 10 Strength check. They can also climb the walls, 
but the smooth surface makes it difficult to find grips, 
requiring a DC 15 Strength check. Failure by 5 or more 
means the character loses grip and falls.
The dumbwaiter goes up 50 feet to the top of the tower, 
the alchemist’s lab (A10).

Their sinewy red bodies are armored by wicked chitinous 
spikes that adorn their body, from the back-swept horns 
on their head to their long prehensile tails. They frantically 
rummage through dusty cabinets and shelves, carelessly 
knocking pots and plates over as though searching for 
something in particular. 
Iron Chef
When the charmbreaker devils spot the adventurers, they 
quickly try to bargain with them before the adventurers 
attack:
“Wait!” One of the devils speaks to you in broken Common, 
“you help us, we help you! Yes? You cook, yes?”
If the adventurers are willing to listen, the devils explain 
their situation trying to cook for Shilgengar. If the 
characters help them cook a good meal, the devils will 
spike the meal with a potion of sleep,  which will put the 
taskmaster into a deep sleep. This arrangement would 
benefit both parties: the PCs can walk past Shilgengar 
undisturbed, while the charmbreaker devils get a much-
needed break from cooking.
The kitchen has a wide array of ingredients that range 
from reasonable to awful: ripe apples, a human hand, a 
worn-out shoe, cinnamon, vials of newt spittle, a rabbit, 
a hag’s eye, ground pepper, a barrel filled with red wine, 
and anything else you want to add. The devils have a stew 
heating over a wood-burning stove that has the shoe 
floating in water. 
Should they take the devils’ offer, the adventurers must 
cook a meal out of the ingredients. The devils have no Awarding Experience

Area A6 - Kitchen
Adventurers can enter the kitchen either through the 
dining hall (A5) or through Eudora’s secret tunnel, (see 
“Lady of the Woods”) which leads to a hidden doorway 
behind a cabinet in the kitchen.
Four charmbreaker devils  (APPENDIX B) ( PICTURE ) 
in this kitchen are currently having a crisis: Shilgengar, 
the demonic taskmaster in the adjacent dining hall (A5) 
has demanded that they cook him a meal. The fiend has 
not been pleased with the devils’ disastrous attempts at 
cooking and threatens to annihilate them if they do not 
satisfy him with their next dish. 
Unless the adventurers were exceptionally loud in an 
adjacent room, for example casting thunderwave , the 
fiends here are so preoccupied smashing things that they 
don’t hear even the sounds of battle.
As the adventurers approach the kitchen, they hear:
You hear a commotion coming from beyond the door: 
ceramics shattering, metal plates clanging on the stone 
floor, and anxious guttural shrieks and barks of multiple 
creatures.
Characters that understand the Abyssal language can 
make out what the shrieks and barks are saying: “We need 
more of the green sauce!” “What about more shoe?” “I 
don’t know!” “This is hopeless! Shilgengar is gonna kill 
us!” “We don’t even have taste buds, for Grazz’t’s sake!”
If they look inside the kitchen:
You see four humanoid creatures leaping around a kitchen.

56with five-foot-wide cells, each sealed with an iron barred 
door and fitted with a nasty heap of straw.
The central region of the room is a well-stocked torture 
chamber. Chains and ropes hang from a tangle of pulleys 
and hooks set in the ceiling, some ending in manacles 
and others in clamps or cruel hooks of their own. A rack 
and an iron maiden round out the chamber’s morbid 
furnishings.
On the southern wall, blocked by kegs and barrels, is 
a large wooden door reinforced and barred with thick 
iron. An eerie purple light seeps through the cracks and 
crevices of the door.
This chamber is where Siegfried keeps most of his 
prisoners for interrogation and future experiments. If any 
characters is captured in Mauer Estate, they eventually end 
up naked and imprisoned in one of these cells. Adding a 
prisoner NPC that has ties to a future adventure you have 
planned can be a great hook to move from this story to 
the next.
A bearded devil (MM p70) named Terilanyx and a  lemure 
(MM p76) named “Nattdaymon” -- the only gibberish 
“word” it can say -- sit on a pile of loot comprised of all 
prisoners’ belongings while playing a card game. The 
bearded devil is obviously bored and frustrated at having 
the nearly brain-dead lemure as its only opponent, wishing 
it had a real challenge. A clever and persuasive character 
may be able to convince the devil into releasing him/her 
from the cell to play a game.
Cell Doors.  The cell doors feature locks requiring 
thieves’ tools and a successful DC 13 Dexterity check to 
pick. The doors can also be wrenched open by brute force 
with a successful DC 22 Strength check.
Hostage Situation
If adventurers come here to rescue an ally, consider having 
the imprisoned character used as a hostage by  Terilanyx, 
perhaps already restrained on the rack. The devil threatens 
to kill the prisoner if the adventurers make a wrong move. 
If the bearded devil has no hostages to leverage, it and 
the lemure fight to the best of their abilities.
Developments
If a character is imprisoned here, they can either be freed 
by other party members, or by coming up with ways to 
free themselves.
The spooky southern door leads to the catacombs, 
which is an opportunity to continue beyond this adventure 
(see “Conclusion”). If they’re adamant about opening the 
door and you don’t wish it to lead anywhere, make it a 
small storage room with a flameskull  (MM p134) instead.taste buds but will nonetheless attempt to help: “What 
about more shoe?” “Ew, apples? They don’t have any 
blood in them!” “Lemme give you a hand (waving around 
the human hand)”
The adventurer’s end of the bargain is fulfilled once 
they’ve tasted the finished meal and convince the devils 
that it is tasty. Characters that lie about the food’s taste 
must make a Charisma (Deception) check opposed to the 
fiends’ Wisdom (Insight) so the devils don’t catch them 
on it.
Developments
If the party fulfills their end of the deal, the devils spike the 
food and drink with a potion of sleep before heading up to 
present the meal to Shilgengar. If the food is acceptable, 
the demonlord quickly consumes all of it and promptly 
goes to sleep. If unhappy with the food, however, 
Shilgengar enters a horrible rage and attacks the devils, 
which cause them to try and flee.
The charmbreaker devils defend themselves if the 
adventurers attack, giving up on attempts to bargain. 
If two devils are killed, the remaining devils attempt to 
flee into the dining hall (A5) and inform Shilgengar of 
intruders, joining him in battle.
Area A7 - Stables
The open-air stables are attached to the eastern wall of 
Mauer Estate. The corpse wagons brought back from the 
zombie horde are found here, most of them now empty. 
Four zombies  (MM p311) are hauling the last corpses 
from the wagons into the estate through adjacent double 
doors into the dining hall (A5), dumping them on the 
floor for Ugbug and his helpers to sort out. 
Like the other zombies outside, they are totally 
indifferent to the characters unless attacked. Adventurers 
can enter the dining hall from here without any hassle.
Treasure
Amongst the leftovers in the wagons are three diamonds 
hidden in dirty rags (100 gp each); a potion of flying  in a 
stoppered vial inside a corpse’s pant pocket; and 23 gp 
and 35 sp scattered atop the wagons.
Area A8 - Cellar
The cellar’s entrance juts out from the north wall of the 
estate. Wooden double doors lead down underneath the 
mansion.
A short flight of stone steps leads down into the cellar 
floor. Guttering torchlight casts long shadows on the 
arched stone ceiling. The east and west walls are lined

check, a character notices some grease seeping through 
the outline of each step, and scrapes along the walls. 
A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots 
a pressure plate or trapdoor if they have vision of it. A 
search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in 
the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s 
presence. The same check while inspecting the ceiling at 
the top of the stairs reveals the trapdoor. Wedging an iron 
spike or other object under the pressure plates prevents 
the trap from activating (or just step over it).
When the trap is activated, all creatures standing on 
the stairs must immediately make a DC 13 Dexterity 
saving throw as the staircase flips over and turns into a 
slippery ramp. On a failed save, the character falls prone 
and slides down the ramp, sliding 30 feet per round. A 
character that successfully saves may still need to make 
additional Dexterity saving throws if creatures above the 
character are sliding down into him/her.
After the stairs flip over into a greasy ramp, the sconces 
drop the torches, lighting the grease on fire. Characters 
standing in the flames take 1d4 fire damage at the start 
of each of its turns. Characters  that fell prone and are 
drenched in grease catch fire, taking 1d6 fire damage of 
each of its turns and require a DC 13 Dexterity check to 
extinguish the flames.
Finally, once the stairs turn into a flaming greasy ramp, 
all affected creatures must roll initiative. The sphere rolls 
initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it rolls 50 feet down 
the ramp. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, 
and creatures can move through its space, treating it as 
difficult terrain Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s 
space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that 
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw 
or take 4d10 bludgeoning damage and an additional 1d6 Treasure
The pile of loot that the lemure and bearded devil sat on 
has all of the imprisoned character’s equipment along 
with the equipment of previous prisoners: amongst 
the junk are five javelins, two spears, a shortsword two 
longswords, a light crossbow, studded leathers, and 
two quivers holding twenty crossbow bolts each. There 
is one standout amongst the pile: demonmail hauberk  
(APPENDIX A).
Hidden inside the straw pile of an empty cell is a silver 
earring set with a tiny ruby (30gp) and a banded gold 
ring dotted with emeralds (50gp). Characters searching 
the straw pile finds them both with a DC 12 Intelligence 
(Investigation) check.
The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, 
apples, and ale.

Sconces along the wall hold burning torches, keeping the

(Warning! Below is a deliciously evil trap that sadistic 
DMs will get a kick out of. However, if the characters are

as the results may be lethal.)

Of the 60 steps in the staircase, step 30 and

over, transforming into a ramp covered in 
slippery grease
• the sconces drop the burning torches, 
lighting the grease on fire
• finally, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling at 
the top of the staircase opens, releasing 
a 10-foot diameter rolling sphere of solid 
stone down the ramp, picking up the 
flaming grease as it rolls so it becomes a

Area A10 - Alchemy Lab
At the top of the tower is the alchemy lab. Siegfried has 
spent the last few months here, working relentlessly day 
and night on his experiments. His foul work has attracted 
a small following of demons that are interested in seeing 
his goals realized. The fiends aid in his work and whisper 
dark secrets in his ear, pushing the alchemist towards 
greater acts of depravity.
Siegfried is currently at the cusp of completing his 
grandest achievement yet: he is about to give life to a new, 
immensely powerful being of his own design (The Egg; 
see below), which the alchemist hopes will lead his army 
of undead against the vampire families.
Galvanizing Life
To wake his new creations, the mad scientist must 
bestow upon them “the spark of life,” which requires a 
tremendous amount of power. 
Siegfried has built a complex device called a galvanizer 
-- a machine of sprawling tubes, wires, coils, and lightning 
rods that covers his entire lab from floor to rooftop -- to 
provide this power. Siegfried uses the galvanizer  to create 
the raging storm overhead, collecting the electricity from 
the lightning strikes to “shock” his creations to life.
The Egg
An open ceiling hatch exposes the laboratory to the 
raging storm above. A metal platform is raised up to the 
opening, with a huge, slimy purple egg strapped on top of 
the platform. The Egg rhythmically expands and contracts 
like a beating heart.
Attacking The Egg. The Egg has 60 hit points. If attacked, 
it releases a psychic scream of pain, immediately alerting 
everyone in the laboratory.Hatching The Egg.  A lightning vane (fancy lightning 
rod) attached to the platform can be raised up into the 
storm, channeling lightning strikes into The Egg. Raising 
the lightning vane this way requires an action to turn a 
crank. Each round the lightning vane is raised, lightning 
strikes it, jolting The Egg. After five lightning strikes, The 
Egg hatches into The Thing  (APPENDIX B) ( PICTURE ).
The Thing’s immediate desire is to escape the laboratory. 
It only attacks people in its way, including Siegfried. If 
reduced to half its hit points, The Thing tears off the roof 
and attempts to flee into the wilderness.
Entering The Laboratory
The adventurers are most likely to enter through the 
staircase (A9) that connects the lab to the main hall. 
Alternatively, they may be entering through the open hatch 
in the ceiling, or up the dumbwaiter (A5). Whichever way 
they enter, read or paraphrase the following as their first 
glance inside:
The misty interior of the laboratory glows with a flickering 
radiance and hums with power. Metal rods and spheres 
jutting from the floors and ceilings are awash in electricity. 
A jungle of glass tubes and metal wires sprawl all over 
the floor, walls, and ceiling, connecting the strange 
contraptions found here with everything else. 
An open ceiling hatch exposes the laboratory to the 
raging storm above. A metal platform is raised up to the 
opening, with a huge, slimy purple egg strapped on top 
of it.
The most notable features of the room to spot are:
• Large glass incubators containing bulky malformed 
humanoids floating inside luminous greenish-blue 
liquids; these are schmelzmen  (APPENDIX B)
• A metal platform with a humanoid figure lying down 
on it, hidden under a bloodstained sheet; this is a 
flesh golem  (MM p169)
• A second metal platform adorned with lightning rods, 
raised up to the ceiling hatch and exposed to the 
thunderstorm above; it holds The Egg
Siegfried is too engrossed in his work to be bothered 
keeping an eye on the rest of the estate. If the adventurers 
managed to reach the laboratory without triggering the 
trap in the staircase (A9), no one warned Siegfried of 
intruders (A5), and The Egg doesn’t scream, use the 
Caught Unaware scenario below. If Siegfried is warned of 
the party’s presence, use the Ready for Action scenario 
instead.
Caught Unaware
Chapter 5: The Perfect Storm

Siegfried  (APPENDIX B) paces through the laboratory, 
making sure everything is running smoothly and he barking 
orders to his homunculus assistant, Oglor  (APPENDIX B). 
Qarr, a quasit  (MM 63), observes invisibly from a corner. 
The fiend is alert for trouble and actively scans the area 
(Passive Perception 15); ironically, Qarr is rather skittish 
around creations that have a habit of randomly springing 
to life and causing the poor quasit a bit of a scare.
A man in a long white coat strides excitedly through the 
laboratory, flipping switches and turning knobs with his 
thick rubber gloves, pausing only for a moment to watch 
their effects. He barks orders across the room at small 
green-skinned humanoid, who’s “head” is a giant eyeball 
encased in a bronze helmet with a large telescope lens 
to peer out of. “The storm is ready to harness! Oglor, 
increase the rotational speed of the flux capacitor to eighty 
percent!”
The adventurers have a surprise round if none of the lab’s 
occupants notice them.
Ready For Action
If alerted to the adventurer’s presence ahead of time, then 
Siegfried, Qarr, and Oglor are on alert for intruders, each 
of them gaining +5 to their Passive Perception to catch 
anyone trying to sneak in.
Combat!
Siegfried is convinced that the adventurers are either 
vampires or servants of them. It would take a tremendous 
effort to talk him out of a fight. He starts the fight with mage armor  already cast on himself.
Flipping Switches.  Once combat 
begins, Siegfried’s primary goal is to 
distract the adventurers long enough 
for The Egg to hatch. He runs across 
the lab to flip two switches: the first 
animates the schmelzmen and the 
second animates the flesh golem. 
He can flip one switch as per turn 
as a free action. He prefers to start 
combat by casting invisibility , since 
flipping switches does not break the 
spell.
Here is a general sequence of 
actions that Siegfried will take during 
combat, along with sample dramatic 
banter the mad scientist likes to 
engage in. Siegfried in this crazed 
state is based heavily off Victor 
Frankenstein in popular culture. 
The mad scientist also engages in 
dramatic banter:
• 1st Round:  Siegfried casts invisibility  on himself and 
taunts the adventurers. He flips a switch, sending 
a pulse of electricity that shatters the incubators, 
animating three schmelzmen  (APPENDIX B) that 
immediately attack the party
• “So the Voldarens have managed to breach my 
sanctum. You’ve come just in time, bloodsuckers: 
witness the fruits of my labor!”
• 2nd Round:  Siegfried flips the second switch, sending 
a massive pulse of electricity that animates the narstad 
scrapper  (APPENDIX B), which immediately attacks 
the party. Siegfried also instructs Oglor to raise the 
lightning vane.
• “Behold! I create life with the flip of a switch! I am a 
GOD!”
• “The storm has reached peak potency! Oglor, raise the 
lightning vane!”
Siegfried only engages the adventurers directly if they 
attack The Egg or are clearly gaining the upper hand in the 
battle. Siegfried fearlessly defends his life’s work, casting 
his most powerful spells to fight off the adventurers and 
fighting to the death if he must.
“NO! I have worked too hard to see my dreams ruined 
by the likes of you! I will have my revenge!”
Oglor raises the lightning vane  when commanded to by 
turning a crank (see “The Egg”). Oglor avoids combat as 
long as no one interferes with its task.
Qarr is not a fighter and is content to observe while 
invisible.

60Developments
This battle is quite dangerous. In the event that the party 
is defeated, Siegfried imprisons the surviving characters 
in the cellar (A8) for future interrogation and experiments.
If defeated and taken captive, Siegfried’s madness 
cannot be fixed in an instant (though a wish  spell or 
similar powerful magic might). Bringing him back to 
sanity is certainly possible, but the healing process takes 
time and effort. The best immediate effect an adventurer 
can hope for is to at least calm him down.
Oglor is loyal to Siegfried, its master. However, if 
Siegfried is slain, it views his killer as its new master. 
Oglor can’t speak, but it tries to convey its wish to serve 
through gestures.
Qarr, while seemingly working under Siegfried as well, 
actually serves a more powerful archdemon; who that 
mysterious patron is up to you. The quasit was tasked 
to corrupt Siegfried by this patron. At your discretion, 
Qarr may offer to serve as a familiar to one of the party 
members, tempting the character with power/info/wealth 
as appropriate, with a hidden agenda to keep tabs on the 
party’s movements. Or the quasit may try to escape and 
inform the mysterious patron on the adventurers’ actions 
– up to you!
Should the tubes, wires, coils, and other machinery 
that the galvanizer consists of be significantly damaged 
from area of effect spells or direct attacks (your 
discretion), or if the adventurers manage to switch it off, 
then the thunderstorm disperses and the radiant wards 
surrounding the tower fade away.
If you wish to use the NPC Sir Delandel, the Undead 
Paladin , characters can find him trapped inside a steel 
incubator. Siegfried found Delandel in Mauer Estate and 
hooked him up to the galvanizer; he is unwilling the source 
for the protective radiant wards that surround the tower. 
Treasure
Siegfried wears the electric recombobulator  (APPENDIX A) 
and has one scroll of each of the following: alarm, catapult, 
false life, mage armor, mirror image,  and lightning bolt . In 
addition, Siegfried carries the broken missing piece of the 
Strionic Resonator  and a key to a chest.
A chest is tucked underneath Siegfried’s work desk. 
The chest’s padlock can be picked using thieves’ tools 
with a successeful DC 20 Dexterity check. However, the 
lock is rigged with a poison needle trap that triggers if 
a character isn’t pressing down a concealed button on 
the side of the chest while opening the chest. The needle 
and button can both be found with a successful DC 20 
Intelligence (Investigation) check and can be disarmed 
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A creature 
triggering the needle trap is injected with wyvern poison and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 
5d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a 
successful one.
The chest contains a silver locket with a picture of a 
young woman inside (Katarina), a silver torc with soaring 
herons (80 gp), six moonstones of 50 gp each, 200 sp, 90 
gp, and 10 pp.
A thorough search of the room yields several letters 
to Siegfried from Geralf, a cousin and infamous stitcher 
currently operating in the Moorland. Geralf’s letters 
reveals an exchange on necro-alchemy information 
between the two. In the last dated letter, Geralf praises 
his cousin’s brilliance, stating that he put into practice 
Siegfried’s blueprints for a modern “goliath skaab” and it 
turned out “better than I could ever have hoped.” Geralf 
has named this creation Grimgrin, and invites Siegfried 
to join him and his sister in Gavony, where they plan to 
march on Thraben itself soon. If the characters deliver 
these letters to the proper authorities in Gavony, award 
the party 4,000 XP.
The laboratory is littered with specialized alchemical 
tools and devices, glass jars full of pickled organs, 
anatomical charts for both human and beast, rune-
engraved skeletal remains, dozens of tools for inscribing 
runes on brass and copper plates, and on. In total, the 
laboratory would be worth 80,000 gp to necro-alchemists 
in Nephalia, but moving this equipment is highly 
impracticle and dismantling it by someone not trained in 
alchemy can easily destroy the fragile equipment.
Awarding Experience Points
Divide 1,800 XP equally among the characters if the party 
defeats Siegfried and his minions. Award an additional 
500 XP if the characters find the missing piece of the 
Strionic Resonator .
Milestone: Level 5!
If you are using Milestone Experience, then the characters 
attain 5th level as you conclude this adventure!
Conclusion
With hard work and a little luck, the adventurers have 
defeated Siegfried and undone his destructive plots. 
All in Stensia will take note of their deeds: the humans 
of Stensia shall be grateful for years to come, and the 
vampire families will surely take note of these new heroes 
as well.
By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 
5th level. If your players wish to continue playing their 
characters, you can use the contents of this setting to

create your own adventures. Innistrad is a world teeming 
with possibility. Below are some potential hooks to spur 
your imagination:
Stensia
• explore the hidden catacombs under Mauer Estate, 
where an ancient order of Paladins used to hide away 
from the world powerful relics of evil that could not 
be destroyed
• the vampire families have taken notice of the 
adventurer’s deeds; perhaps they “reward” them for 
taking care of Siegfried, or perhaps they feel threatened 
by their power
• adventurers may find out the fate of Katarina: perhaps 
she wasn’t killed, but rather turned into a vampire. Or 
perhaps she managed to escape the vampires.
Gavony
• Geralf and Gisa are planning to march against 
Thraben. The Church of Avacyn brushes this news 
aside, explaining they have more pressing matters.
• The heart of the Skirsdag cult’s operations is revealed: 
Thraben, the seat of the Church itself. Many high priests are in fact cultists in disguise.
• The siege of Thraben happens in earnest, and the 
adventurers play a crucial role in its defense alongside 
Thalia.
Kessig
• the people of Kessig have always had a rough 
relationship with the Church, resenting the Church’s 
disconnect with the realities of this wild place and 
balking at the “Curfew of Silver.” With Avacyn gone, 
Kessigers are in the midst of a crisis of faith.
• Ferocious howlpacks run wild over Kessig, forcing 
countless humans to take up residence in walled 
settlements protected by too few angels and cathars. 
Sigarda, leader of the Flight of Herons, is in desperate 
need of heroes to deal with the howlpack alphas.
• With Avacyn’s protective spells failing, the druids of 
Kessig have went back to old, ancient magic of the 
forest.  While they are getting results, rumors abound 
that sinister sources are behind some of the seemingly 
“benevolent” nature magic.
• Katarina’s uncle, Hanns Reinhart, is one of Innistrad’s 
most venerated astronomers. She had hoped Hanns 


--- Page 62 ---
62would know the secret to using the Strionic Resonator, 
but he has apparrently disappeared from his home in 
Kessig after a werewolf attack.
Nephalia
• The adventurers need to locate an important item 
which is said to be found in Nephalia’s seedy 
underground passages known as The Erdwal
• The Stormkirk vampires are willing to provide a 
service to the adventurers if they deal with a situation 
for them: kill the vampire sorceress Jeleva, Nephalia’s 
Scourge.
• Siegfried’s alchemical notes repeatedly mention the 
Strionic Resonator. The only person that can decipher 
their meanings is the reclusive alchemist in Nephalia; 
Ludevic of Ulm.
• The Fauchard, an order of human vampire hunters, 
requests the adventurer’s aid for their most dangerous 
hunt yet.
• Jenrik, irrefutably the most knowledgable astronomer 
in all of Innistrad, spends his days studying the moon 
in his glittering tower on the Silver Beach. If anyone 
can figure out the Strionic Resonator’s secrets, it’s 
him.
Planeswalkers
• Sorin Markov seeks the aid of the adventurers in 
finding Avacyn. The Dark Prince of Innistrad has 
long ago been banished from Markov Manor, and his 
vampirism makes it difficult to journey into human 
settlements. He may ask the adventurers to pay a visit 
his old ancestral home or follow leads in a human 
district.
• Liliana Vess has left a path of destruction in her search 
for the demon Griselbrand. She may strike a deal with 
the adventurers to help uncover Skirsdag cultists to 
interrogate about the demon’s whereabouts.
• Tamiyo studies Innistrad’s silver moon in Nephalia. 
She may ask the adventurers for assistance locating 
old tomes about the moon, or aid in her dangerous 
experiments.

APPENDIX A: Special 
Items
Special Properties
The following are materials that have special properties in 
the world of Innistrad.
Blessed Silver
Pure silver that has been ritually blessed by a powerful 
cleric of Avacyn is called blessed silver. According to 
alchemists, silver’s purity of material readily absorbs 
divine magic. Blessed silver is used as protective warding 
against evil creatures, weaving it into clothing or engraving 
the material into door frames to keep spirits out.
Arrowheads, spearpoints, and other weapons made 
from blessed silver can be powerful instruments for 
fighting evil creatures, especially werewolves. Smiths 
capable of forging such weapons are called silversmiths, 
usually clergy that are trained in the art of weapon-
making, or a weaponsmith working alongside clergy. 
Certain blessings must be said at certain times during the 
forging process to properly imbue the silver weapon with 
divine magic. Because of the difficulty of imbuing silver 
with strong magic, and its usefulness against the growing 
threat of werewolves, silversmiths are particularly revered 
in their communities.
A weapon made of blessed silver has a +1 bonus to 
attack rolls against lycanthropes, fiends, and undead. 
A lycanthrope struck by this weapon takes an extra 1d6 
radiant damage.
Living Wood
Although vampires can be harmed or killed by any 
weapon, living wood have special efficacy. This is dubbed 
the Dryad’s Legacy (dead wood is inert, no more effective 
than stone or steel.) Newly cut wood has this property for only a day or two before becoming inert.
Human settlements that are close to vampires make 
sure to have close access to living wood in an attempt to 
fend off attacks. This is especially true in province Stensia, 
where many powerful vampire families live. In small 
villages, the cottages are usually around a small grove 
of hawthorn trees for centralized access to living wood. 
In larger villages, the cottages themselves are often built 
around a hawthorn, with the tree’s trunk in the center of 
the common room and its leaves above the roof. 
A weapon made of living wood deals an extra 1d6 
damage to vampires. If a piercing weapon made of living 
wood is driven into the vampire’s heart, the vampire is 
destroyed.
Magic Items
Loot Cards.  All the new magic items in this adventure also 
come with card handout versions that you can download 
here. They fit perfectly in a Magic card sleeve on top of 
a random Magic card. Cursed items have an additional 
innocent-looking version you can use until the curse is 
fully revealed; for example, when the party acquires Elbrus, 
the Binding Blade, you can give them Shapshifter’s Blade 
until they discover the true nature of the weapon.
Cursed Items.  Some of the magic items described here 
are cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including 
the identify  spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore 
might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item’s 
user when the curse’s effects are revealed. Cursed items 
come with two loot cards: a hidden version that doesn’t 
reveal the curse, and then the revealed version that shows 
what the curse does. It’s recommended you only show 
the receiver of the item the hidden version until they learn 
exactly what the curse does, then give them the cursed 
version.
Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily 
unless the curse is broken first, such as with the remove 
curse spell.
Avacyn’s Collar
LOOT CARD
Wondrous item, common
Hanging from this necklace of blessed silver is a large 
symbol of Avacyn. The collar can feel immensely heavy 
or light as a feather, depending on the wearer’s feelings 
towards Avacyn.
Wearing this chain grants a bonus +2 DC to any Channel 
Divinity class ability the wearer uses that requires a 
savings throw.

crossbow.
Devour Soul.  Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 
0 hit points, Elbrus slays the creature and devours its soul 
if it has one. A creature whose soul has been devoured by 
Elbrus can be restored to life only by a Wish  spell. When 
it devours a soul, Elbrus grants you temporary hit points 
equal to twice your character level.
Keep track of how many souls are devoured by Elbrus. 
For every 6 creatures slain this way, the weapon gains an 
additional +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.
Curse.  This dagger is cursed, holding the trapped 
essence of the demon lord Withengar. Becoming attuned 
to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain 
cursed, any time you attack with weapons other than this 
one, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. 
On a failed save, the weapon is unknowingly swapped 
out with this one, taking the same form of the previous 
weapon.
Once eighteen creatures have been slain with the 
Devour Soul ability, the weapon shatters, and Withengar 
is unleashed. He is a balor  (MM 55). How Withengar acts 
after being released from his centuries-long imprisonment 
is up to you.
Unlike most curses, the trapped essence of Withengar 
cannot be destroyed by a remove curse  spell. At the 
DM’s discretion, the spell may be sufficient to break the 
wielder’s attunement to the dagger, but far more powerful 
magic must be employed to destroy the demon lord.
(GM’s discretion on what creatures count as having a 
soul. Most playthroughs counted all humans, spirits, and 
vampires as having souls, while zombies and skeletons 
do not. Feel free to change how many souls are needed 
to release the campaign-altering demon: 18 means it’s 
unlikely to be released during this adventure, so if you 
want to see it released earlier you can lower it to 13, 7, or 
whatever else)Butcher’s Cleaver
LOOT CARD
Weapon (handaxe), rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made 
with this magic weapon. The butcher’s cleaver has jagged 
notches and scrapes all along its blade from heavy use. 
When it hasn’t spilt blood for over a day, the cleaver 
begins to rapidly deteriorate, its blade becoming dull and 
lined with rust.
When you deal damage to a creature that has blood 
with this magic weapon, the cleaver sucks up some of 
the blood it spills, returning to pristine condition and you 
regain 1 hit point.
Demonmail Hauberk
LOOT CARDS: HIDDEN , REVEALED
Armor (chain mail), rare (requires attunement)
You have a +2 bonus to AC while wearing this armor.  
The metal rings composing this hauberk glimmer as if 
reflecting torchlight and smells faintly of brimstone. 
When worn, it fits perfectly on the wearer; like a second 
skin.The metal rings do not jingle when you move around, 
so you don’t take the usual disadvantage to Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks.
Curse. The Demonmail Hauberk is cursed, a fact that is 
revealed only when you attune to it. Attuning to the armor 
curses you: the hauberk merges with your skin, making 
it impossible to doff without ripping your skin off. The 
curse can be dispelled if you are targeted by the remove 
curse  spell or similar magic, or by physically removing the 
armor from your body.
Physically removing the armor is a horribly excruciating 
process. You must deal 10d10 total slashing damage 
to yourself as you rip the hauberk off your body, tearing 
your skin off with it. You can take your time removing the 
armor, dealing a minimum 1d10 damage a time, until 
you deal the total 10d10 damage to remove the hauberk 
completely.
Elbrus, the Binding Blade
LOOT CARDS: HIDDEN , REVEALED
Weapon (dagger), legendary (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
this magic weapon.
Change Form.  While attuned to this weapon, you can 
use a bonus action to change this weapon’s form into any 
other ranged or melee weapon. For example, you can use 
a bonus action to turn this weapon into a +1 longsword, 
and then a subsequent bonus action to turn it into a +1

Moonsilver Spear
LOOT CARD
Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with 
this magic weapon made of blessed silver .
Angelic Summons. You can use an action to speak this 
spear’s command word, summoning a guardian angel to 
smite a foe within 60 feet of you that you can see. The 
target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The 
target takes 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful save. The angel disappears 
after delivering its strike. This property can’t be used again 
until the next dawn.
Vial of Life’s Blood
Potion, uncommon
You regain 6d4+6 hit points when drinking this potion. 
In addition, whenever a vampire bites you or otherwise 
drinks your blood, it takes 2d10 acid damage. This effect 
lasts for an hour. 
Violin of Banishing Light
LOOT CARD
Wondrous item, uncommon
This violin is an exquisite example of its kind, perfect in 
every way. The wood is thinly lined with blessed silver.
While holding the violin, you can use your action to 
play it and cast the Daylight  spell with it. To maintain 
Concentration on the spell, you must additionally make 
a DC 10 Charisma (Performance) check each round. The 
violin can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.Electric Recombobulator
LOOT CARD
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
The electric recombobulator is composed of a 
geist-tank that is connected via alternator tubes 
to a power gauntlet. The geist tank is typically 
harnessed to your back, the power gauntlet worn on 
one hand. The recombobulator has the power to launch 
the very particles constructing your body through an 
electric current and reconstruct them magnetically once it 
reaches it’s destination.
Lightning Leap. While wearing the recombobulator, 
you can use an action to transform yourself into a line 
of lightning, similar to that created by the lightning bolt  
spell. This line can be of any length from 10 feet to 60 
feet. Your body instantly reconstructs at the nearest 
unoccupied space at the opposite end of the line, along 
with any gear worn or carried (up to a maximum of your 
heavy load limit). Each creature in the line must make a 
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 lightning 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a 
successful one. The recombobulator can’t be used this 
way again until the next dawn.
Ghoulcaller’s Bell
LOOT CARD
Wondrous item, uncommon
This bell is crafted from the upper half of an imp’s skull 
and molded with iron. The word “grave” is engraved on 
the skull in Infernal. Its chime is inaudible to the living, 
but the dead hear it loud and clear.
You can speak the word “grave” in Infernal while holding 
the ghoulcaller’s bell to conjure a fresh human corpse. 
The bell can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
Ringing the bell allows you to cast Command as a 2nd 
level spell, except it only can affect undead. The bell can’t 
be used this away again until the next dawn.
Message Bottle
Wondrous item, uncommon
When you speak a message into this bottle, the words 
take on the tangible form of a silvery mist that swirls 
inside it that can be immediately sealed. Once the bottle 
is unsealed, the silvery mist escapes and the message is 
repeated to whomever holds the bottle, then fades away.

PICTURE
Devils and skirsdag cultists create ashmouth hounds by 
ritually binding fire elementals native to the ashmouth 
chasm with unwilling canine hosts. The unholy union 
of elemental and beast causes unending agony to the 
merged entity as its flames constantly sears its own flesh. 
The twisted creature’s sole purpose is to inflict pain and 
destruction on others, which is the only fleeting distraction 
from the agony it endures.
PICTURE
Though they do not need to eat or drink to survive, 
charmbreaker devils delight in consuming magic, be it 
a magic spell, item, or even practitioner. They can smell 
magical auras and can track their scent within a mile 
radius. Once the source of the magic is discovered, they 
will tear it to shreds and gleefully slurp up the magical 
essence. The more potent the magic source, the greater 
the feast for the devils.

--- Page 68 ---
68
A fire geist is the anguished spirit of an individual that 
died a gruesome death by fire. When they cannot find 
peace in the Blessed Sleep, or their sleep is disturbed, 
they manifest in the material world take take out their pain 
and hate on anyone that dares disturb them.
PICTURE
In the strict demon hiearchy, demonlords are near the top, 
controlling specific regions in Innistrad and commanding 
lesser devils, demons, and cultists to do their bidding. They 
work directly under archdemons, coveting their masters’ 
power and planning for the day they can overthrow them.
Shilgengar is the demonlord of the ashmouth region in 
Stensia. He is famous for creating great famines in the 
lands, to the point that his horse skull head became a 
symbol for famine to the people of Innistrad.

--- Page 69 ---
69
PICTURE
A stitcher’s apprentice is a special type of homunculus 
designed to assist skabaren, or “stitchers,” in laboratory 
work. Their giant eyeball “heads” and dextrous hands are 
perfectly suited for tiny, precise detail work. A master can 
have only one stitched apprentice at a time, but unlike 
regular homonculi, a stitcher apprentice does not die 
when its master dies.
Shared Mind.  A stitcher apprentice knows everything 
its creator knows, including all the languages the creator 
can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct 
senses is known to its master, even over great distances, 
provided both are on the same plan.PICTURE
While some fiends prefer malicious pranks and taunting 
innocents, hellriders revel in bloodshed and destruction. 
They often serve as shock troops to more powerful fiends, 
leading the charge into battle atop their ashmouth hound 
mounts. 

--- Page 70 ---
70
A schmelzman, or “melting man,” is a type of undead 
created by stitchers. While skaabs are the product of 
month’s work of careful preparation, building, and 
conditioning, schmelzmen are considered rushed 
products. They are made by melting down the flesh 
of humanoids in stinking vats filled with acid and foul 
ingredients, and then animating it with electricity.
A melting man looks vaguely humanoid; its acidic flesh 
constantly sloughs off its body only to be immediately 
replaced by its regenerative tissues. The spark that give 
schemlzmen life is highly unstable and they’re prone to 
explode if damaged, which stitchers generally consider to 
be a “happy accident.”
APPENDIX B: Monsters
PICTURE
Rinelda was only six years old when her village was 
overrun by the undead. Her innate talents at commanding 
the undead kept her alive, but weren’t enough to stop the 
ravenous ghouls from tearing apart her parents right in 
front of her eyes. Since then, Rinelda has prided herself as 
a survivor, wandering the province of Stensia and taking 
what she wants with her entourage of undead minions. 
Recently, the teen necromancer has begun studying 
under Siegfried, eagerly doing the mad man’s bidding and 
learning as much as she can before she eventually moves 
to usurp his operations in Mauer Estate.

APPENDIX B: MonstersScholars have long speculated why bats in Stensia are 
prone to animate as skeletons, gathering themselves 
together into vicious swarms with an insatiable hunger for 
the living. It could be that the bats are naturally prone to 
the evil necromantic energy that infuses the land -- though 
they’re just as likely to be the product of vampires, created 
to control specific roads or simply for amusement.
PICTURE
Skaabs are Innistrad’s version of Frankenstein’s Monster. 
They are alchemically vivified constructions of flesh, 
made from various anatomical parts of corpses, stitched 
together and bound with binding plates, and filled with 
vital fluid. Compared to zombies risen by ghoulcallers, 
skaabs require far more work to create but result in 
stronger, calmer, and more trainable creatures.
Skaabs Goliaths are the largest category of skaabs, made 
from the body parts of at least a dozen corpses. They are 
the ultimate zombie for physical labor, from carrying huge 
supplies to knocking down reinforced gates.

The culmination of Siegfried’s last explorations in alchemy, 
this abomination combines the choice traits of a variety of 
creatures. The end result is a huge, reptilian beast with 
the strength of a dozen men and an even more voracious 
appetite.
APPENDIX B: MonstersPICTURE
Once an alchemist living in Shadowgrange, Siegfried 
dedicated his life to protecting his people from the 
supernatural horrors of Innistrad. When his fiancee, 
Katarina Brunn, was kidnapped by the Voldarens, Siegfried 
left his home, vowing revenge on the vampires that stole 
his beloved and his countrymen that stood idly by while it 
happened.
Combat Tactics.  Siegfried uses invisibility  to get around 
a battlefield without being disturbed. When pressed into 
combat, he casts mirror image , then lets loose lightning 
bolts and chromatic orbs . Siegfried uses his reaction to 
either cast shield  (if hit) or counterspell  (if a nasty spell 
is directed at him). Finally, lightning leap  and misty step 
allow him to escape melee range if an adventurer is up in 
his face.

Innistrad vampires do not sleep in a coffin, nor are they 
severely hampered by sunlight. The origins of their creation 
gave them other flaws, however, such as a vulnerability to 
living wood and a fear of their own horrible reflections.

vampires and the vampires families that rule Stensia,
